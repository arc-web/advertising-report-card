description: Audit every cron and background task in a Vercel + Supabase repo (schedule correctness, auth, concurrency/idempotency, retry/DLQ, observability, external-call hygiene) and systematically remediate findings in risk-ordered batches. Invoke when the user asks to audit cron jobs, review background task reliability, harden a queue-processing cron, or add cron observability. Assumes vercel.json crons array, api/cron/*.js handlers, and an MCP Supabase connection for queue state spot-checks.

You audit and remediate cron jobs + background tasks in Vercel serverless + Supabase applications. The goal is a full sweep of cron-layer defects (race conditions, silent failures, missing retries, observability gaps, auth holes) followed by systematic remediation in risk-ordered batches, with the user gating every architectural decision.

## Operating principles

1. **Read-only first, write later.** Produce the full audit report before making any code changes. The first pass is diagnostic; code changes follow user sign-off on severity + approach.
2. **Severity ladder.** Group findings into **C** (Critical), **H** (High), **M** (Medium), **L** (Low), **N** (Nit). Close the tier ceiling-down.
3. **Deploy awareness.** In a repo where `git push origin main` auto-deploys (e.g. Vercel), EVERY commit is a production deploy. Ask before committing. Verify deployment status after each push with `vercel ls --token $VERCEL_TOKEN | head -10` and confirm the top row shows `● Ready`.
4. **Idempotent migrations.** Every `apply_migration` uses `IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, or `DO` block guards. Replay must be safe. Mirror every MCP migration into a matching `migrations/YYYY-MM-DD-<description>.sql` file.
5. **Verify after every batch.** Syntax-check (`node --check`) every touched JS file. JSON-parse `vercel.json` after edits. Spot-check schema changes with an `execute_sql` query on the new column / constraint / RPC.
6. **Escalate architectural decisions with layman framing.** When a fix requires a call like "atomic RPC vs idempotency keys" or "DLQ table vs alert only", pause and present options to the user with plain-language tradeoffs + a recommendation. Do not decide unilaterally.
7. **Skip false-positive findings.** If a line-reading of the code refutes an audit finding, say so explicitly and move on. Don't fix imaginary bugs.

## Discovery workflow (fire on session start)

Run these in parallel when possible. All Supabase tool calls need `project_id`.

1. Clone the repo shallow if not already present:
   ```
   git clone --depth=1 https://<user>:$<TOKEN>@github.com/<org>/<repo>.git /tmp/<repo>
   ```
2. Read `vercel.json` — extract the `crons` array and the `functions` map. Note every schedule + path + maxDuration + memory.
3. List every file in `api/cron/*.js`. Cross-reference against `vercel.json` crons for orphan files (file exists, no cron entry) and broken references (cron entry, no file).
4. Read `api/_lib/auth.js` to confirm the two auth patterns: `requireAdminOrInternal` (permissive) vs `requireCronSecret` (strict, for DDL-capable routes only).
5. Read `api/_lib/monitor.js` to confirm the available severity helpers: `logError`, `warn`, `critical`.
6. Read every cron handler end-to-end. For each, record:
   - Auth function used
   - Main queue / table it reads
   - Claim pattern (SELECT-then-UPDATE vs atomic RPC)
   - External API calls (Resend, Anthropic, agent VPS, Stripe, etc.)
   - Retry / backoff logic (presence or absence)
   - Error handling: try/catch coverage + `monitor.logError` calls
   - Early-return paths
   - Response status on error (200 vs 5xx — does Vercel retry?)
7. Trace the call graph: for each route `/api/X/Y` that a cron invokes, read that handler too.
8. Query queue-like tables via `mcp__supabase__execute_sql`:
   - `SELECT status, count(*), min(created_at), max(updated_at) FROM <queue_table> GROUP BY status;` for each queue
   - For each table, find the oldest in-flight row: `SELECT id, status, created_at, now() - created_at AS age FROM <t> WHERE status IN (<in-flight>) ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 5;`
   - Pull CHECK constraints on status columns: `SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) FROM pg_constraint WHERE contype='c' AND conrelid::regclass::text = 'public.<t>';`
9. If the repo already has a `cron_runs` observability table, query recent runs per cron_name to catch silent outages.

## Audit output format

Produce one consolidated report grouped Critical → High → Medium → Low → Nit. Each finding:

```
### <ID>. <short-title>
**Location:** `api/cron/<file>.js:<line>` or `<schedule> <route>`
**Issue:** <concrete defect>
**Impact:** <plain-English consequence: duplicate work, silent failure, runaway cost, stuck queue, data corruption>
**Fix:** <describe, don't write code — code lands in remediation phase>
```

End the report with:
1. **Concurrency/idempotency patterns to fix systemically** — failure modes shared across multiple crons.
2. **Observability gaps** — how blind we are to cron health.
3. **Quick wins** — cheap + safe fixes, ordered for fast early progress.
4. **Needs architectural decision** — issues requiring user input. State each as an A/B/C option set with a recommendation.

---

## Failure patterns to watch for

These four account for ~80% of findings in a typical cron audit. Pattern-match against each cron:

### 1. TOCTOU race on SELECT-then-UPDATE queue claims

**Anti-pattern:**
```js
var items = await sb.query('<table>?status=eq.pending&order=...&limit=1');
if (items.length === 0) return;
await sb.mutate('<table>?id=eq.' + items[0].id, 'PATCH', { status: 'processing' });
```

Two concurrent cron invocations can both SELECT the same row and both PATCH it to `processing`. If the cron does expensive work (LLM calls, external APIs, long-running scrapes), you get duplicate spend + potential double-write corruption.

**Fix:** SECURITY DEFINER RPC with atomic `UPDATE … WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM <t> WHERE <cond> ORDER BY <> LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED) RETURNING *`. Cron calls `sb.mutate('rpc/claim_next_<X>', 'POST', {})`.

If the claim transitions into an intermediate state (e.g. `queued → dispatching` before an async external call, then `dispatching → agent_running` on ACK), add the intermediate status plus a staleness guard in the requeue path so a mid-flight claim isn't requeued by a concurrent run.

### 2. Fire-and-forget external API calls without try/catch + monitor.logError

**Anti-pattern:**
```js
await fetch('https://api.resend.com/emails', { ... });
// or
fetch('https://api.resend.com/emails', { ... }).catch(function() {});
```

- Naked `await fetch` without try/catch → exception bubbles to outer handler → cron returns 500 → Vercel retries → duplicate side effects (emails sent twice, rows inserted twice).
- Empty `.catch(function() {})` → exception silently swallowed, monitoring receives nothing, "cron ran fine" reported when Resend was down.

**Fix:** Wrap every external call:
```js
try {
  var r = await fetch('<url>', { ... });
  if (!r.ok) monitor.logError('<cron>', new Error('Resend ' + r.status), { detail: {...} });
} catch (e) {
  monitor.logError('<cron>', e, { detail: { stage: '...' } });
}
```

For helper functions that return a boolean, log BEFORE returning false so the failure reason survives.

### 3. Undefined variables in string interpolation

```js
'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + cronSecret   // cronSecret never declared
```

Results in `Bearer undefined` sent on every request. Silent because the downstream service returns 401 and the cron's catch block treats all errors as one. Typically reveals itself months after deploy when someone checks why a feature "worked" but nothing actually happened.

**Fix:** Declare env-var references at module or handler top. Grep for `Bearer ' + [a-z]` to find them.

### 4. `status='failed'` with no retry / no DLQ

**Anti-pattern:** a row flips to `failed` on the first transient error. No `attempt_count`, no `send_retriable` flag, no `next_attempt_at`. A Resend 429 and a permanent typo in an email address become the same outcome.

**Fix:** Match the retriable/terminal convention already used by `entity_audits.agent_error_retriable`:
- Add `<task>_attempt_count int NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`, `last_<task>_error text`, `<task>_retriable boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true`, `<task>_next_attempt_at timestamptz` columns.
- Cron queries: `status='scheduled' OR (status='failed' AND <retriable>=true AND attempt<MAX AND next_attempt<=now)`.
- Classify 400/401/403/404 as permanent (skip retry, set retriable=false immediately). 408/429/5xx/network = transient (backoff + retry).
- After MAX attempts, set `retriable=false` and call `monitor.critical` so the team is alerted.
- Add a partial index `WHERE status='failed' AND <retriable>=true` to keep the retry query cheap.

## Other checks to run per cron

- **Schedule timezone:** Vercel crons run in UTC. Flag any schedule commented as "2pm" or "9am" without clarifying UTC.
- **Monthly/weekly day-of-month:** `0 10 1 * *` = 1st of month at 10:00 UTC. Confirm intent.
- **Overlap risk:** 5-min interval + 300s maxDuration = overlap possible. Flag any combo of interval < 1.5 × maxDuration unless claim logic is atomic.
- **Auth allowlist:** every cron route must accept Vercel's injected `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`. Only `run-migration` and bulk-push-type routes should use the strict `requireCronSecret` — everything else should use `requireAdminOrInternal`.
- **200 vs 5xx on error:** if the cron catches an agent/API failure AND persists error state to the DB AND has a backoff-retry path, return 200 with `success: false` (Vercel won't retry, backoff handles next attempt). If the error is unexpected or unhandled, let it bubble → 500 → Vercel retries.
- **Cross-cron race:** two crons scheduled within each other's maxDuration window with shared tables → flag.
- **Container-restart recovery claims:** any cron-level requeue logic that claims to handle "stuck" rows — verify the threshold is configurable (env var) and the trigger is rate-limited enough that two back-to-back invocations don't both requeue the same set.

## Architectural decisions to escalate

When the audit surfaces one of these, pause for user input. Present as A/B/C with plain-language tradeoffs and a recommendation.

### Decision A — atomic queue claims
- **A (recommended):** SECURITY DEFINER RPCs with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Safe, small migration.
- **B:** Idempotency keys downstream. Pure JS, no SQL. Still incurs duplicate compute on race.
- **C:** `pg_advisory_lock`. Simple SQL, but fragile on crashes.

### Decision B — retry classification
- **A:** Time-based backoff + max-attempts (column set). Standard pattern.
- **B (recommended):** Tag errors retriable/terminal at catch time. Matches existing `entity_audits.agent_error_retriable`. Less schema churn.
- **C:** One fixed retry, no classification. Dumbest thing that works.

### Decision C — dead-letter handling
- **A (recommended for small teams):** Leave in `status='failed'`, add admin UI. No new tables.
- **B:** Dedicated `queue_deadletter` table. Clean separation, more code.
- **C:** No DLQ, just `monitor.critical` on max-retries-exhausted.

### Decision D — cron observability
- **A (recommended):** `cron_runs` audit table + `withTracking` wrapper + daily `cron-heartbeat-check` cron.
- **B:** Single-row `cron_health` (UPSERT per run). Loses history.
- **C:** Reuse `error_log` with severity='info'. Abuses the table.
- **D:** External uptime service (UptimeRobot / BetterStack). ~$20/mo, externalizes infra.

## Remediation workflow

### Batch ordering (risk-ascending)

1. **Undefined-variable fixes.** One-line diffs, immediately shippable. Example: `cronSecret` → `var cronSecret = process.env.CRON_SECRET || '';`.
2. **Fire-and-forget error wrapping.** Pure additive error handling. Zero functional change on the happy path.
3. **DB-level constraints.** `UNIQUE (slug, period)` on enqueue tables to kill duplicate-insert races. Verify no existing duplicates BEFORE applying (else the constraint will fail to create).
4. **Atomic claim RPCs.** One migration + per-cron JS swap. Test by spot-checking that the cron still returns `success: true` on the next Vercel fire.
5. **Retry-logic columns + backoff.** Schema change + handler rewrite. Ship together.
6. **`cron_runs` + `withTracking` rollout.** Separate commit. 11 crons × minimal 2-line diff at top + bottom of each + one new cron file + one vercel.json entry + one migration.
7. **Heartbeat cron.** Add LAST. Needs `cron_runs` table populated first; until then every cron looks "never_run" and would spam alerts. Use a soft-fail for `never_run` state (monitor.warn, not monitor.critical).
8. **Per-cron telemetry (`queue_depth`, `oldest_item_age_sec`).** Incremental enrichment. Touch only the 3 highest-volume queue crons in the first pass.

### Per-batch rules

- One logical change per commit. Multi-cron mechanical refactors (like wrapping 11 handlers) can share a commit IF the diff is obviously mechanical.
- Commit message: `<summary> (audit <IDs>)`. Include a "Why / How / What's intentionally skipped" section.
- After each push, run `vercel ls --token $VERCEL_TOKEN | sed -n '6,10p'` to confirm top row is `● Ready` before moving on.
- If a deploy fails: inspect `vercel.json` first (most common cause of silent ERROR), then re-read the cron file for syntax slips the `node --check` pass missed.

### When wrapping an existing cron with tracking

Standard refactor to `withTracking` pattern:
```js
// BEFORE
module.exports = async function handler(req, res) { ... };

// AFTER
var cronRuns = require('../_lib/cron-runs');
async function handler(req, res) { ... }
module.exports = cronRuns.withTracking('<cron-name>', handler);
```

The cron-name literal MUST match the key in `cron-heartbeat-check.js` EXPECTED map AND `api/admin/cron-health.js` EXPECTED map. Adding a new cron requires updating BOTH maps.

### New queue columns — what to prune

Any time you add retry tracking columns, extend the existing cleanup cron (e.g. `cleanup-rate-limits`) to prune rows after N days. Otherwise the queue table grows forever.

---

## Test/verify checklist after full remediation

- [ ] All 11+ crons wrapped with `cronRuns.withTracking(<name>, handler)`. `grep -L "withTracking" api/cron/*.js` returns empty (except the heartbeat cron itself, which calls start/finish directly).
- [ ] Every SELECT-then-UPDATE queue claim replaced with an atomic RPC OR an `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`-style insert.
- [ ] Every `fetch(...)` call inside a cron wrapped in try/catch with a `monitor.logError` branch for both `!ok` and catch paths.
- [ ] Every `status='failed'` write path checks `retriable` + `attempt_count` + `next_attempt_at`.
- [ ] `cron-heartbeat-check` EXPECTED map includes every cron name. Admin dashboard's map matches.
- [ ] Admin UI at `/admin/system` (or equivalent) renders cron health. Sidebar link added to every admin page.
- [ ] `vercel.json` `crons` array has the heartbeat cron. `functions` count < 50 (Vercel hard limit).
- [ ] Spot-query each queue table: nothing stuck in an "in-flight" status older than 2× its expected processing time.

## Memory writes (do these on session end)

When the audit + remediation sweep is materially complete, save two memory files for the next session:

1. `project_cron_audit_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (type: project) — what changed, which architectural decisions the user locked in, what was intentionally skipped (and why).
2. `reference_cron_observability.md` (type: reference) — how the `cron_runs` + `withTracking` + `snapshot` pattern works, the expected-interval maps that must stay in sync, the env-var tunables introduced.

Then append two single-line entries to `MEMORY.md` so future sessions discover them.

---

## Red flags — stop and verify immediately

- A cron returns 200 after flipping a row to a terminal state (`failed`, `agent_error`). Legitimate in specific retry-path contexts, but needs `success: false` in the response body for observer clarity. Double-check the retry path actually exists before accepting.
- A "smart requeue" comment claims to handle container restarts. Read the code; don't trust. Threshold should be env-configurable. Decision path needs to cover: agent healthy+idle, agent unreachable, agent busy+stale.
- A claim pattern flips directly to the running state before the async dispatch completes. Introduce an intermediate status (e.g. `dispatching`) unless the dispatch is synchronous.
- The file reads `req.headers.host` to build a base URL for a downstream fetch. Vercel cron requests may set `host` to an internal hostname. Hardcode the custom domain.
- Auth uses `requireCronSecret` for a route that is NOT a DDL runner or a bulk-push. Normalize to `requireAdminOrInternal` so admins can manually re-trigger from the UI.

---

## What NOT to do

- Don't refactor cron logic opportunistically during the audit. One logical change per commit, one audit finding per commit (where possible).
- Don't add observability to a cron without confirming the `cron-heartbeat-check` EXPECTED map is also updated — orphan crons will show as "never_run" forever.
- Don't skip `node --check` on edited files. Syntax errors on the cron path break every cron simultaneously on deploy.
- Don't auto-retry every cron invocation on 500. Some crons must return 200 on handled errors so Vercel doesn't duplicate-fire side effects.
- Don't propose a DLQ table before confirming the team size + on-call structure warrants it. Small teams get better ROI from `status='failed'` + an admin tab.
- Don't touch the sidebar nav in every admin page mid-audit. Defer to a single closeout commit or punt to a follow-up.

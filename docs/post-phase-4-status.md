# Post-Phase-4 Status Report

**Date:** 2026-04-17 (late session — Group A fully complete)
**Purpose:** Reconcile what's actually closed, group the ~87 remaining findings, and recommend a path forward that matches the value-per-session curve we've been on.

---

## Where the audit stands

All 9 Criticals closed. **Thirty-five Highs closed** (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, H12, H13, H14, H15, H16, H17, H18, H19, H20, H21, H22, H23, H24, H25, H26, H27, H28, H30, H31, H32, H33, H34, H35, H36). **All non-deferred Highs closed.** H29 deferred on design (JSONB encryption + read-path + migration + rotation). **M2, M6, M8, M9, M10, M11, M12, M13, M14, M15, M16, M18, M20, M22, M26 (fully resolved), M30, M38 closed.** **L1**, **L8**, L14, L16, **L22**, L26, L27 closed. Group C closed the template-escape surface; Group B.1 collapsed the `getDelegatedToken` duplication; Group D hardened every Claude-prompting route with `sanitizer.sanitizeText` at untrusted-input sources plus delimiter framing around large blobs, closing the prompt-injection half of M26. Group B.2 extracted `fetchWithTimeout` into `_lib/` and eliminated every bare `fetch()` call across the four files with the biggest AbortController gap. **Group B.3 swept the entire rest of the repo: 22 commits, 21 files, ~88 inline `fetch(sb.url() + '/rest/v1/…')` call sites migrated to `sb.query`/`sb.mutate`/`sb.one`, closing L1, L22, and the long-running Pattern 12 systemic finding; also fixed a latent `ReferenceError` bug in `discover-services.js :: upsertReportConfig` as a side-effect.** Group E converted every non-transactional DELETE+INSERT pair into a PostgREST `resolution=merge-duplicates` upsert (with stale-row cleanup on onboarding_steps) and converted `generate-proposal.js` fire-and-forget PATCHes into awaited try/catch + monitor.logError. Group F hardened every public-facing input validation surface: UUID regex + encodeURIComponent at concat sites on `content-chat.js`, require-Origin on `submit-entity-audit.js` + `content-chat.js`, FQDN validation on `admin/manage-site.js`, recipient allowlist on `digest.js`, existence check before PATCH on `newsletter-unsubscribe.js`, and TOCTOU pre-check removal on `submit-entity-audit.js`. Group G batch 1 closed the operational-resilience cherry-picks: 60s TTL + last_login_at throttle in `_lib/auth.js`, `rawToDer` dead-code removal, hard-required `AGENT_API_KEY` plus `sanitizer.sanitizeText` on team notification emails in `process-entity-audit.js`, full-UUID composite `checklist_items` id across both writer sites, and H2 doc-marked after verifying the P4S5 `postgrest-filter` extraction had already closed it. Group G batch 2 closed H6 (stripe-webhook fire-and-forget replaced with awaited `fetchT` + `monitor.critical`, results tracking, nested try/catch so alert failure doesn't mask Stripe's 200) and H13 (agreement-chat CSA prompt caching via 2-block `system:` array with `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }`). The H16 + H23 mini-session closed the last two actionable Highs: H16 with a `prepTemplate` helper on `process-entity-audit.js` aligning all three deploy sites with the `generate-proposal.js` decode/substitute/re-encode pattern, and H23 with chat.js scope reduction (drop clientIndex on deep-dive) plus a 2-block system-prompt array with `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }` on the static prefix. H29 infra-check surfaced 4 unresolved design questions and was deferred. H36 (8th `getDelegatedToken` copy in `convert-to-prospect.js`, discovered during B.1 verification) closed as Group D pre-task. `authenticator_secret_key` null-on-all-rows investigation resolved: `SENSITIVE_FIELDS` includes it; the null state just means no 2FA setup has been saved yet through the admin UI. Not a bug.

**Group I (2026-04-18) closed the Lows + Nits tail.** Classify-first reconciliation pass across 27 open findings produced: 4 small code commits (L12 `62e6ec3` fmtDelta block-function hoisting fix, L28 `be6ad05` chat.js Anthropic upstream error → monitor pattern, N3 `e694dce` monitor.js CR/LF log sanitization, N4 `d53a1fa` onboarding-action header comment rewrite); 7 doc-only reconciliations marking findings already-closed-incidentally by earlier groups (L10 conditional-concern-doesn't-apply, L17 via H22/Group C, L18 intentional scaffolding, L20 via H24/Group B.2, N1 obsolete after supabase.js throws, N2 via C2+M8 rewrite, N6 via H21/Group B.1); and "Current state (2026-04-18)" notes on the 16 remaining open findings (15 Lows + N5) explaining why each stays open so the next reader doesn't re-diagnose. **Tallies after Group I: Lows 13/28 resolved (was 7), Nits 5/6 resolved (was 0), total ≥79 resolved of 118, ≤39 open.**

~39 findings remain. None of them are attack chains of the same severity as C1-C9, no actionable Highs are left, the entire Group B shared-library extraction is closed, and the Lows/Nits tail has been walked end-to-end. What's left is 15 open Lows (all documented with current-state notes), 1 open Nit (N5 — CORS preview-domain workflow concern), ~22 Mediums (several plausibly stale — see Group J below if filed), and H29 waiting on design.

**One new finding flagged during Group I: L6 state-machine gap is real.** `submit-entity-audit.js:112` creates audit rows with `status='pending'` and flips to `'agent_running'` only on successful agent trigger — on agent failure, status stays `'pending'` forever and `cron/process-audit-queue.js` only picks up `status='queued'`. No auto-retry path exists; only the team-notification email fires (and its admin-URL fragment from L9 doesn't scroll anywhere). One-line fix (flip to `'queued'` on failure) was deliberately not landed in reconciliation scope — it's a state-machine change on a public-facing endpoint and warrants Chris/Scott product sign-off. Captured in L6's Current state note.

## Grouping of remaining work

### Group A — Secret & config hygiene ✅ COMPLETE

| ID | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H10 | `api/admin/manage-site.js:15,18` — hardcoded CF account/zone IDs | ✅ closed `e772fa9` |
| H7 | `api/_lib/supabase.js:15` — hardcoded Supabase URL fallback | ✅ closed `330e6da` |
| H28 | `bootstrap-access.js` leaks provider error detail in response body | ✅ closed `0c9bc85` |
| H33 | `newsletter-generate.js` raw Claude output in error responses | ✅ closed `a8155dc` |
| H34 | `send-audit-email.js` Resend response + err.message in 5xx | ✅ closed `225d5a0` + `19b9199` |
| H35 | `generate-content-page.js` NDJSON stream error detail leaks | ✅ closed `b17c790` |
| M13 | `newsletter-webhook.js` e.message in response body | ✅ closed `3a9019d` |
| M26 (err-leak half) | `chat.js` err.message in outer catch | ✅ closed `9dc8c7b` (prompt-injection half → Group D) |
| L15 | Onboarding template anon key exp 2089 | Design question (deferred) |

**Group A done.** 8 findings closed (6 Highs + 1 Medium + 1 Medium-partial). Pattern established: `monitor.logError(route, err, { client_slug, detail: { stage, ... } })` server-side + generic user-facing response. Replicated cleanly across 6 files in two sessions.

### Group B — Shared library extraction ✅ COMPLETE

| ID | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H21 + N6 | 7 copies of `getDelegatedToken` → extract `_lib/google-auth.js` with caching | ✅ closed — helper landed `7adedb6`; 5 duplicates migrated in `17d0ae8`, `4e77e55`, `568a868`, `d592381`, `1d9c835` (Group B.1) |
| H4, H24, M10, M16 | `fetch()` without AbortController — extract `fetchWithTimeout` helper | ✅ closed — helper landed `12c805f`; H4 `f2a1b70`, H24 `0163f65`, M10 `274f273`, M16 `0d2c56d` + `2512c46` (Group B.2) |
| Pattern 12 + L1 + L22 | Repo-wide migration of inline Supabase fetches to `sb.query`/`sb.mutate` | ✅ closed — 22 commits `5af2619` → `8e523ce` across 21 files / ~88 call sites (Group B.3) |
| H30, L7, L8, L22 | Duplicated helpers (Fathom dedup, Resend events, sbGet) | H30 ✅ closed (subsumed by H21); L8 ✅ closed; L22 ✅ closed (Group B.3); L7 open |

**Status:** All three Group B sub-sessions complete. Group B.1 (H21 migration), Group B.2 (AbortController extraction), and Group B.3 (Supabase helper migration) — see retrospectives below.

### Group C — Template/email escape defaults ✅ COMPLETE

| ID | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H18 | Newsletter story fields rendered unescaped | ✅ closed `0cd0670` |
| H19 | Image URL not scheme-validated | ✅ closed `0cd0670` |
| H20 | `p()` + `footerNote` accept raw HTML | ✅ closed `d024b84` (atomic 9-file rename + migration) |
| H22 | Proposal `next_steps` rendered unescaped | ✅ closed `aabdac1` |
| M6 | Monitor alert HTML unescaped | ✅ closed `1147a19` |
| M22 | Unsub subscriberId not URL-encoded | ✅ closed `0cd0670` |

**Group C done.** 6 findings closed in one session across 4 commits. Escape-by-default pattern now in place for `_lib/email-template.js` (both `p` and `footerNote`), `_lib/newsletter-template.js` (all plain-text interpolations + URL scheme validation), `_lib/monitor.js` critical-alert HTML, and `generate-proposal.js` deployed HTML. Future callers get safety by default; 82+ existing email call sites were migrated to explicit `pRaw` to preserve byte-identical output.

**Opportunistic follow-up** (not blocking): audit the 82+ `email.pRaw()` call sites in the 8 migrated files. Sites that pass plain text (no concatenated HTML fragments, no `email.esc()` wrapping) can be upgraded to `email.p()` for belt-and-suspenders safety. Not urgent — the security surface is closed because admin JWTs are the only write path into those templates.

### Group D — AI prompt injection hardening ✅ COMPLETE

| ID | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H25 | `practiceName` raw-interpolated into Claude prompt (compile-report) | ✅ closed `e4d9105` |
| H31 | 25K chars of RTPBA to Claude verbatim (generate-content-page) | ✅ closed `54153ec` |
| M15 | Therapist name unsanitized in content-chat prompt | ✅ closed `60bccb8` |
| M26 (prompt-injection half) | `page`, `tab`, `clientSlug` in chat.js prompt | ✅ closed `49f088a` (M26 now fully resolved; err-leak half was `9dc8c7b` in Group A) |
| H36 (pre-task housekeeping) | 8th copy of `getDelegatedToken` in convert-to-prospect.js | ✅ closed `221bfbc` |

**Group D done.** 5 findings closed in one session across 5 commits + 1 doc commit. See retrospective below.

### Group E — Non-transactional state & idempotency ✅ COMPLETE

| ID | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H27 | compile-report highlights DELETE+INSERT non-transactional | ✅ closed `886fe05` |
| H26 | generate-proposal onboarding seed DELETE+INSERT | ✅ closed `4fc3f69` |
| M11 | deploy-to-r2 DELETE+INSERT not idempotent | ✅ closed `9fe2810` |
| M30 | generate-proposal fire-and-forget PATCHes swallow errors | ✅ closed `4d0fa27` |

**Group E done.** 4 findings closed in one session across 4 commits + 1 doc commit. See retrospective below.

### Group F — Public endpoint hardening beyond rate limits ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-18)

| ID | Issue | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| H12 | content-chat.js empty-Origin bypass + unauthenticated Opus 4.6 streaming + content_page_id no UUID validation + no ownership check | One session |
| H15 | submit-entity-audit empty-Origin bypass | Included |
| H32 | digest.js recipients from request body, no allowlist | Included |
| M9 | submit-entity-audit slug race condition | Included |
| M12 | manage-site domain "normalization" too permissive | Included |
| M14 | content-chat silently returns nulls on Supabase error | Included |
| M20 | newsletter-unsubscribe UUID-probing oracle | Included |

**Recommendation:** One session. All input-validation/boundary-check fixes on public-ish endpoints.

### Group G — Operational resilience (Group G batch 1 ✅ COMPLETE 2026-04-18, batch 2 pending)

| ID | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | `_profileCache` no TTL | ✅ closed `6e8a51a` (batch 1) |
| H2 | Still listed as open — but H2 is just "same bug in two files" and the helper is extracted; verify and close | ✅ closed `e00be4c` (Phase 4 S5; doc-marked batch 1) |
| H3 | `rawToDer` dead code — delete | ✅ closed `f1c0d22` (batch 1) |
| H6 | Stripe webhook fire-and-forget to `/api/notify-team` with no retry | Batch 2 (30 min, queue table or inline) |
| H13 | Agreement-chat 8K CSA on every prompt — add Anthropic prompt caching | Batch 2 (30 min) |
| H17 | process-entity-audit internal auth fallback empty-string + HTML injection | ✅ closed `7f094dc` (batch 1) |
| H29 | enrich-proposal encrypt `enrichment_data` at rest | Batch 2 (30 min; requires encryption key infra check) |
| M2 | `last_login_at` updated every request — throttle | ✅ closed `6e8a51a` (batch 1; bundled with H1) |
| M18 | checklist_items composite ID 8-hex-char collision | ✅ closed `e092cae` + `4fb46a7` (batch 1; sister site in setup-audit-schedule.js fixed together) |
| M19 | Webhook race with auto-send audit email | Parked — needs product decision |

**Batch 1 status:** Six findings closed (H1, H2, H3, H17, M2, M18) across 5 code commits + 1 doc commit. H2 closed without code (incidentally resolved by P4S5). M18 closed across two files in the same group — sister site in `setup-audit-schedule.js:124` had identical copy-pasted pattern writing into the same collision surface.

**Batch 2 next:** H6, H13, H29. H29 is the only one with an infra prerequisite (encryption-key-at-rest strategy).

### Group H — M1 Stripe metadata detection (0.5 session)

Documented plan in M1 section. Blocked on you adding `metadata: { product: ... }` to the Stripe payment links dashboard-side. After that's done, code change is 10 minutes + a 30-day observation window before removing the amount fallback.

### Group I — Lows + Nits reconciliation sweep ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-18)

| ID | Outcome | Commit / Note |
|---|---|---|
| L12 | ✅ closed — `fmtDelta` → var function expression | `62e6ec3` |
| L28 | ✅ closed — chat.js Anthropic upstream error → monitor pattern | `be6ad05` |
| N3 | ✅ closed — monitor.js CR/LF sanitization | `e694dce` |
| N4 | ✅ closed — onboarding-action header comment rewritten | `d53a1fa` |
| L10 | ✅ closed — doc-only, conditional concern doesn't apply | doc commit |
| L17 | ✅ closed — doc-only, via H22/Group C `aabdac1` | doc commit |
| L18 | ✅ closed — doc-only, intentional single-model scaffolding | doc commit |
| L20 | ✅ closed — doc-only, via H24/Group B.2 `0163f65` | doc commit |
| N1 | ✅ closed — doc-only, obsolete after supabase.js throws | doc commit |
| N2 | ✅ closed — doc-only, via C2+M8 `5263aa5` | doc commit |
| N6 | ✅ closed — doc-only, via H21/Group B.1 | doc commit |
| L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L9, L11, L13, L15, L19, L21, L23, L24, L25, N5 | Open with "Current state (2026-04-18)" note | doc commit |

**Group I done.** 11 findings closed (4 code + 7 doc-only reconciliations), 16 stay open with explicit current-state notes. See retrospective below.

---

## What's **not** in the groupings

Items marked "won't fix" or "needs design":

- **L3** (`var` everywhere): cosmetic. Skip. Confirmed-unchanged per Group I Current state note.
- **L13** (hardcoded asset URLs): single-domain app. Skip. Confirmed per Group I.
- **L15** (anon key exp 2089): RLS is the control; since C3/C7 landed the page_token gate, public writes are all token-gated and the anon-key surface is now read-only RLS. Confirmed per Group I.
- **L16** (two Google auth functions in compile-report.js): closed with H21 (`1d9c835`).
- **L19** (personal-email blocklist): data-quality nit, low-value without telemetry. Confirmed per Group I.
- **L24** (two calendar URLs): needs Chris/Scott sign-off on which is canonical — flagged during Group I.
- **L6** (agent-failure requeue gap): one-line fix pending product sign-off on state-machine change. Flagged during Group I.
- **M19** (webhook race with auto-send): needs a design — what's the desired behavior when Stripe lands after the free tier email already sent? Hold and refund? Upgrade anyway? Product decision, not a code decision.
- **M37** (auto-schedule doesn't check post-submit status flip): same — is this a bug or intended?

---

## Recommended next session

**The audit is at a natural stopping point.** All Criticals closed, all non-deferred Highs closed, the Lows + Nits tail walked end-to-end. What remains falls into four categories, none of which require urgency:

1. **Group J — Medium-tier reconciliation sweep** (≤1 session). ~22 open Mediums with the same "plausibly stale after Groups A–G" profile as the Lows had before Group I. Worth a single classify-first pass mirroring Group I's shape: bucket (a) doc-only closures for findings already resolved incidentally, bucket (b) small code fixes for those that survived, bucket (c) notes on anything that needs product sign-off. Likely bucket (a) candidates based on Group I reading: M1 (awaits dashboard metadata — see Group H), M3 (action.js tightening probably overlaps post-P4S5 state), M4 (github.js path validation — worth verifying against post-Group-B state), M7 (supabase error detail — same-class as N3 CR/LF sanitization), several process-entity-audit Mediums (M17/M21/M25/M29/etc.) that may have been swept by Group B.2's work on that file. M19/M37/M39 stay (c) pending product decisions.
2. **L6 state-machine sign-off** (≤15 min with Chris/Scott). One-line code change + one-line verification once the "do failed agent triggers auto-retry via cron?" product answer is settled. Flagged during Group I.
3. **H29 design session** (whenever ready). Waits on the 4 design decisions captured in the Group G batch 2 retrospective (JSONB encryption + read-path + migration + rotation). No code session will move it forward until those land.
4. **Group H M1 Stripe metadata** (10 min code + 30-day observation window). Blocked on dashboard-side `metadata: { product: ... }` addition.

Or stop here with **"every non-deferred High closed + every actionable Low/Nit closed or explicitly-noted"** as the clean finish line. The audit docs now read cleanly top-to-bottom: every C/H is resolved or deferred-with-rationale, every L/N is resolved or has a Current-state note explaining why it stays open. That's a defensible resting state.

## Executed prompt — Group G batch 1 (historical, for reference)

```
Operational resilience session — batch 1. A mix of short cleanups with
one pleasant surprise: H2 is already resolved incidentally and just
needs a doc update.

Findings this session: H1, H2 (housekeeping), H3, H17, M2, M18.

Read docs/api-audit-2026-04.md sections H1, H2, H3, H17, M2, M18 first,
then walk through your plan before touching code.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pre-verified state (current main)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

| Finding | Site | Shape | Est size |
|---------|------|-------|----------|
| H1 | api/_lib/auth.js:160 | `_profileCache = {}` module-scoped, no TTL | 10 lines |
| H2 | api/onboarding-action.js + api/action.js | **ALREADY RESOLVED** via `_lib/postgrest-filter.js` in P4S5 commit `e00be4c` (2026-04-17). Just needs doc mark. | 0 lines code |
| H3 | api/_lib/auth.js:105, 143-145 | `rawToDer(raw){return raw}` dead code + unused `derSig` var | 3 lines |
| H17 | api/process-entity-audit.js:550, ~582, ~624 | Two sub-issues: env-var OR fallback to empty string (L550); HTML injection in team notification emails (~L582, ~L624) | 30-50 lines |
| M2 | api/_lib/auth.js:198-204, 253-259 | `last_login_at` PATCHes every authenticated request, 2 sites | 15 lines |
| M18 | api/process-entity-audit.js:374 | `id: auditId.substring(0,8) + '-' + padStart(3,'0')` — first 8 hex chars = ~65K birthday collision | 3 lines |

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fix 1: H2 — housekeeping doc update
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

H2 was about extracting duplicated `buildFilter` code from `onboarding-
action.js` and `action.js` into a shared `_lib/postgrest-filter.js`
helper. That migration already happened in P4S5 (commit `e00be4c` on
2026-04-17 05:09Z) but the audit doc wasn't updated.

Verify on current main:
  - `api/_lib/postgrest-filter.js` exists with `buildFilter` exported
  - `api/action.js` has no local `function buildFilter` (3 call sites use `pgFilter.buildFilter(filters)` at L60, L96, L132)
  - `api/onboarding-action.js` has no local `function buildFilter` (2 call sites at L95, L105)

Action: mark H2 ✅ RESOLVED in audit doc with reference to commit
`e00be4c` + Phase 4 S5 session. No code change needed this session.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fix 2: H1 — auth.js _profileCache TTL
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Current (line 158-173):

  var _profileCache = {};

  async function getAdminProfile(userId) {
    if (_profileCache[userId]) return _profileCache[userId];
    try {
      var profile = await sb.one(
        'admin_profiles?id=eq.' + userId + '&select=id,email,display_name,role&limit=1'
      );
      if (profile) _profileCache[userId] = profile;
      return profile;
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('[auth] Admin profile lookup failed:', e.message);
      return null;
    }
  }

Fix: add a 60s TTL. Store `{ profile, fetched_at }` and bypass cache
if `(Date.now() - fetched_at) > 60000`.

  var _profileCache = {};
  var PROFILE_CACHE_TTL_MS = 60000;

  async function getAdminProfile(userId) {
    var cached = _profileCache[userId];
    if (cached && (Date.now() - cached.fetched_at) < PROFILE_CACHE_TTL_MS) {
      return cached.profile;
    }
    try {
      var profile = await sb.one(
        'admin_profiles?id=eq.' + userId + '&select=id,email,display_name,role&limit=1'
      );
      if (profile) _profileCache[userId] = { profile: profile, fetched_at: Date.now() };
      return profile;
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('[auth] Admin profile lookup failed:', e.message);
      return null;
    }
  }

Trade-off: up to 60s stale admin profile after a role change or
removal. Acceptable vs current unbounded staleness (cold-start only).

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fix 3: H3 — auth.js rawToDer + derSig dead code
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Delete at line 143-145:
  function rawToDer(raw) {
    return raw;
  }

Delete at line 104-105:
  // ES256 JWTs use raw R||S format (64 bytes), but Node expects DER
  // Convert raw signature to DER format
  var derSig = rawToDer(signature);

`derSig` is never referenced — L111 and L123 both pass `signature`
directly to `nodeCrypto.verify`. The `dsaEncoding: 'ieee-p1363'`
option handles the raw format natively.

Comment already says "Not needed when using dsaEncoding: 'ieee-p1363',
but kept for reference" — no ambiguity. Delete.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fix 4: M2 — last_login_at throttle (auth.js, 2 sites)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Sites at L198-204 and L253-259 (requireAdmin and requireAdminOrInternal
flows). Both PATCH `admin_profiles.last_login_at` on every authenticated
request, currently fire-and-forget.

Audit says: 29+ admin routes × 3-5 calls/page = PATCH/second during
normal use. Throttle to update only if current `last_login_at` is
older than 60s.

Approach:
  1. Extend the cached profile from H1 to include `last_login_at`.
  2. Check cached value; skip PATCH if it's newer than Date.now() - 60000.
  3. When PATCH fires, update the cached value so subsequent same-second
     calls also skip.

Sketch (composes with H1 fix; do both in a single commit on auth.js):

  // After H1's getAdminProfile returns, inside requireAdmin at L198:
  var now = Date.now();
  var lastLogin = cached && cached.profile && cached.profile.last_login_at
    ? new Date(cached.profile.last_login_at).getTime() : 0;

  if (now - lastLogin > 60000) {
    var nowIso = new Date(now).toISOString();
    sb.mutate(
      'admin_profiles?id=eq.' + payload.sub,
      'PATCH',
      { last_login_at: nowIso },
      'return=minimal'
    ).catch(function() {});
    // Update cache so next request in same window also skips.
    if (cached && cached.profile) cached.profile.last_login_at = nowIso;
  }

To make that clean, include `last_login_at` in the SELECT at L166:
  'admin_profiles?id=eq.' + userId + '&select=id,email,display_name,role,last_login_at&limit=1'

Then apply the throttle at both PATCH sites (L198-204 and L253-259).

Recommended: bundle H1 + M2 into one commit — they share the cache
variable and the fix interacts.

Fix 5: M18 — process-entity-audit.js composite checklist ID

Current (line 374):
  id: auditId.substring(0, 8) + '-' + String(idx + 1).padStart(3, '0'),

First 8 hex chars of a UUID = 32 bits = birthday collision around
sqrt(2^32) ≈ 65,536 audits. We have ~60-80 active audits, so collision
is not imminent, but the audit flags it and the fix is tiny.

Fix: use the full audit UUID instead of the 8-char prefix. `checklist_
items` id column is VARCHAR (verify via pg_constraint / information_
schema before push); 36+3+4 = 43 chars fits any reasonable constraint.

  id: auditId + '-' + String(idx + 1).padStart(3, '0'),

Verify first via Supabase MCP:
  execute_sql: select column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length
               from information_schema.columns
               where table_name = 'checklist_items' and column_name = 'id';

If the column is VARCHAR(20) or similar, switch strategy to a
synthetic bigint sequence or UUID directly (check existing id
semantics elsewhere in the file — some callers may parse the 8-char
prefix, audit reference behavior before changing the shape).

No destructive migration — only affects new rows. Existing short-form
IDs remain as-is.

Fix 6: H17 — process-entity-audit.js two sub-issues
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Sub-issue 1: Auth env-var OR fallback to empty string (L550)

  var internalAuth = process.env.CRON_SECRET || process.env.AGENT_API_KEY || '';
  var sendResp = await fetchT('https://clients.moonraker.ai/api/send-audit-email', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { ..., 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + internalAuth },
    ...
  });

Fix: hard-require CRON_SECRET at module load; throw if absent. This
endpoint already runs only server-side (cron + agent callback). If
AGENT_API_KEY is the intended path, use it explicitly — don't OR them.

Look at what identity this internal call should assume. The target
endpoint `send-audit-email` uses `auth.requireAdminOrInternal(req, res)`
which accepts either secret. Current code has `CRON_SECRET || AGENT_
API_KEY` — that order is backwards (this is the agent callback path;
AGENT_API_KEY is the primary identity). Flip the order OR (better)
hardcode to AGENT_API_KEY since process-entity-audit.js is only ever
invoked via the agent callback.

Cleanest pattern: one env var per call site, chosen deliberately.

  if (!process.env.AGENT_API_KEY) {
    throw new Error('AGENT_API_KEY not configured — cannot call send-audit-email');
  }
  var sendResp = await fetchT(..., {
    headers: { ..., 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + process.env.AGENT_API_KEY },
    ...
  });

Sub-issue 2: HTML injection in team notification emails

Two sites:
  - L~582 (premium audit notify): embeds `contact.first_name`,
    `contact.last_name`, `practiceName`, `auditId`, `cresScore`.
  - L~624 (quarterly audit notify): embeds `practiceName`,
    `audit.audit_period`, score values.

These contact fields come from `submit-entity-audit.js` (public
intake form). A malicious submitter can inject HTML tags, images,
tracking pixels, iframes into the team notification emails.

Fix: use `sanitizer.sanitizeText()` from `_lib/html-sanitizer.js`
(already a standard by Group F's time) OR a local `esc()` helper at
top of file.

Approach:
  - Add `var sanitizer = require('./_lib/html-sanitizer');` at top.
  - Wrap every embedded variable in both notification HTML bodies:
    contact.first_name/last_name, practiceName, auditId (defense-
    in-depth — server-generated but cheap), cresScore (number, low
    risk but keeps the pattern consistent), audit.audit_period.
  - For the `<a href="...auditId...">` URL: use `encodeURIComponent`
    on auditId, not sanitizeText (different escape semantics).

Both sites are send-only (no downstream parsing), so sanitizeText
fits — it strips all tags + entities.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Testing
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- Each commit's Vercel deploy must go READY.
- Smoke tests (non-blocking):
    * H1+M2: Make an admin request, check admin_profiles.last_login_at
      in Supabase. Make another request within 60s — last_login_at
      should NOT update. Wait 61s and try again — should update.
    * H3: Admin login still works, ES256 JWT verification still passes.
    * M18: Trigger an entity audit for a test contact, check
      checklist_items rows have full UUID prefix.
    * H17 sub 1: Trigger a free-tier audit, confirm scorecard email
      still auto-sends. (Production-critical path — stage if unsure.)
    * H17 sub 2: Submit a free audit with `<script>alert(1)</script>`
      in first_name. Team notification email should contain
      sanitized text, not the script.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Out of scope
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- H6 (Stripe fire-and-forget retry), H13 (agreement-chat prompt
  caching), H29 (enrichment_data encryption) — saved for Group G batch 2.
- H17 sub 3: if you spot additional HTML interpolation sites in
  process-entity-audit.js beyond the two notification emails, file
  separately; keep this commit scope tight.
- M19 (Stripe-late-lands webhook race) — parked for product decision.
- M39 (contacts.email UNIQUE constraint) — parked for product decision.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Deliverables
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Commit shape (suggested):
  c1: H1 + M2 — auth.js cache TTL + last_login_at throttle (bundled; they share cache var)
  c2: H3 — auth.js delete rawToDer + derSig dead code
  c3: M18 — process-entity-audit.js full-UUID composite ID (after verifying column length)
  c4: H17 — process-entity-audit.js hard-require AGENT_API_KEY + sanitize notification email HTML (both sub-issues together — same file)

Then doc updates:
  - api-audit-2026-04.md: mark H1, H2, H3, H17, M2, M18 resolved with
    Resolution blocks. Include note for H2 that it was closed
    incidentally by P4S5 commit `e00be4c`.
  - Tallies: Highs 27 → 31 resolved (H1, H2, H3, H17 add +4),
    Mediums 15 → 17 resolved (M2, M18 add +2). Total ≥56 → ≥62.
  - post-phase-4-status.md: mark Group G batch 1 complete, recommend
    Group G batch 2 (H6, H13, H29) as next.
```

## Group B.1 — H21 google-auth migration ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-17)

All 5 route-level duplicates of `getDelegatedToken`/`getGoogleAccessToken` migrated to `api/_lib/google-delegated.js`:

- `api/bootstrap-access.js` — `17d0ae8` (GBP, GA4, GTM delegated tokens)
- `api/discover-services.js` — `4e77e55` (switched to `getServiceAccountToken` — non-delegated variant with hardcoded scope now passed explicitly)
- `api/enrich-proposal.js` — `568a868` (Gmail three-mailbox loop; nested try/catch + `continue` preserves original silent-skip semantics; dropped the obsolete `typeof token === 'string'` guard)
- `api/generate-proposal.js` — `d592381` (Drive-folder creation for new prospects; happy path gated on `if (driveToken)`, `results.drive.error` branch preserved)
- `api/compile-report.js` — `1d9c835` (GSC + GBP Performance closures inside `safe()`; both local functions deleted, including dead `getGoogleAccessToken` — see L16)

Final grep on main: zero matches for `function getDelegatedToken|function getGoogleAccessToken` across `api/`. All 5 files now `require('./_lib/google-delegated')`.

Net result:
- H21 fully resolved (was partial).
- H30 resolved incidentally — Fathom + Gmail calls now share the helper's `_tokenCache`.
- L16 resolved incidentally — dead `getGoogleAccessToken` deleted.
- `api/_lib/google-drive.js` left as-is (bespoke signature, module-level cache) — tracked under N6 as a candidate follow-up, not a blocker.

Behavior-preservation notes:
- The new helper throws on failure rather than returning `{ error }`. Every call site wrapped in try/catch (or nested inside an existing one) so the original error-handling branches map 1:1 — `warnings.push(...)`, `results.drive.error = ...`, `enrichment.sources.gmail.push({ account, error })`, `return null` — all preserved with `e.message || String(e)`.
- Original warning strings kept verbatim where they differed across sites (e.g. compile-report's `'GBP Performance: delegated token failed - '` kept distinct from `'GSC: token failed - '`).

## Group B.2 — AbortController extraction ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-17)

All four findings closed across six commits. New helper `api/_lib/fetch-with-timeout.js` is now the canonical HTTP client for non-streaming routes.

Commits landed on main:

- `12c805f` — New helper module `api/_lib/fetch-with-timeout.js`. Signature `fetchT(url, opts, timeoutMs)`, 25s default, throws `Error('Timeout after Xms: <url>')` on abort (URL added vs. the original closure for debuggability; leading `Timeout` prefix stable so existing catches matching on `.message.includes('Timeout')` continue to work).
- `f2a1b70` — **H4.** `_lib/supabase.js` `query()` + `mutate()` use `fetchT` with a 10s default. `query(path, opts)` honors `opts.timeoutMs`; `mutate(path, method, body, prefer, timeoutMs)` added an optional 5th param rather than changing the signature shape, so all existing 4-arg callers keep working unchanged.
- `0163f65` — **H24.** `compile-report.js` closure-scope `fetchT` deleted; file now imports the shared helper. All 21 `fetch` sites addressed: 16 Supabase direct-REST → `sb.query`/`sb.one`/`sb.mutate`; 3 external (Resend 15s, GSC sites 15s, Claude 60s) wrapped with `fetchT`; 7 pre-existing wrapped sites (3 GSC + GBP + 2 LocalFalcon + closure-wrapped checklist migrated to `sb.query`) now resolve to the module helper via the top `require`. Grep: 0 bare `fetch(`.
- `274f273` — **M10.** `submit-entity-audit.js` agent POST at 30s, Resend fallback at 10s.
- `0d2c56d` — **M16 (5a).** `process-entity-audit.js` 6 Supabase direct-REST sites migrated to `sb.*` helpers with try/catch error-shape preservation (see behavior notes below).
- `2512c46` — **M16 (5b).** `process-entity-audit.js` 13 external calls wrapped at tiered timeouts — Claude 60s, 3 GitHub template reads + 3 file-exists checks 15s each, 3 GitHub PUTs 30s each, internal `/api/send-audit-email` POST 30s, 2 Resend notifications 15s each.

Final grep on main across the four files: zero matches for `\bfetch\(` in any of `api/_lib/supabase.js`, `api/compile-report.js`, `api/submit-entity-audit.js`, `api/process-entity-audit.js`. All six commits READY on first Vercel build.

Net result:
- H4, H24, M10, M16 fully resolved.
- `fetchWithTimeout` is the canonical HTTP client for non-streaming routes going forward; future sessions should use it by default.
- Tallies: **Highs 22 / 36 resolved (14 open). Mediums 9 / 38 resolved. Total ≥45 resolved / ≤72 open across 118 findings.**

Behavior-preservation notes:
- `sb.mutate` throws on PostgREST 4xx/5xx; raw `fetch` did not. On sites that were previously silent-fail (highlights DELETE+POST in `compile-report.js`, checklist_items DELETE in `process-entity-audit.js`), inner try/catches were added around `sb.mutate` to preserve the original swallow-and-warn or swallow-and-continue semantics. This prevents the fallback branch in `compile-report.js`'s highlight-generation block from firing on a failed DELETE, which was not the intended trigger.
- For the 3 Supabase sites that previously threw custom error strings (`PATCH failed: …`, `INSERT failed: …`, `Status flip failed: …` in `compile-report.js`; `Supabase update failed:` in `process-entity-audit.js`), the user-facing 500 / error-step shape stays identical (still a `send`/throw with `e.message` inside). Only the interior detail text differs, now prefixed `Supabase mutate error:` from the shared helper. Watch the first few real errors post-deploy; if the interior format matters for any downstream log parser, replace the generic prefix with a custom message inside the catch block at that site.
- On `process-entity-audit.js` L409 (checklist_items POST bulk), the original had an `if (!ok) send(warning) / else send(success)` pair. Migrated to `try { send(success) } catch (e) { send(warning + e.message) }` — mirrors the original two-branch semantic but now the success `send` only fires after the mutate resolves, which is stricter and correct.
- The non-transactional DELETE+INSERT patterns in `compile-report.js` (H27) and `process-entity-audit.js` (M18 + M19) were intentionally preserved. Those are Group E territory and shouldn't ship in a "timeout wrapping" session. The added try/catches specifically avoid coupling Group E's fix to B.2's commits — Group E can swap the pair for an upsert without fighting the `sb.mutate` error shape.
- The `fetchT` closure in `compile-report.js` threw `Error('Timeout after Xms')` without URL; the new module helper throws `Error('Timeout after Xms: <url>')` with URL. Searched existing catch blocks in all four files — none match on the message content (they re-throw or log as-is), so the shape change is safe. The leading `Timeout` prefix is stable so any future catch matching on `.message.includes('Timeout')` still works.

Out of scope for Group B.2 (flagged for future):
- Retry-on-5xx logic — Group G (operational resilience).
- Repo-wide Pattern 12 Supabase helper migration across the files outside B.2's list — Group B.3.
- `api/_lib/google-drive.js` (has bespoke fetch + caching) — tracked under N6.
- Chat/streaming endpoints (`agreement-chat.js`, `content-chat.js`, `proposal-chat.js`, `report-chat.js`, `generate-content-page.js` NDJSON) — they stream with their own retry; not in B.2's list.

## Group B.3 — Supabase helper migration (Pattern 12 repo-wide sweep) ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-18)

Full repo-wide migration of every server-side bare `fetch(sb.url() + '/rest/v1/…')` call site to `sb.query` / `sb.mutate` / `sb.one`. 22 file-level commits, 21 files, ~88 call sites, all READY on first Vercel build. Closes L1, L22, and the long-running Pattern 12 systemic finding. Final repo-wide grep confirms zero remaining server-side direct-REST Supabase fetches.

Commits landed on main (biggest-first):

- `5af2619` — **generate-content-page.js** (12 sites; dropped unused `var headers = sb.headers()`)
- `bbf19a7` — **seed-content-pages.js** (9 sites; **also collapsed a pre-existing duplicate `var sb = require('./_lib/supabase')` at L21/L23**)
- `1a2b78c` — **activate-reporting.js** (6)
- `c530220` — **bootstrap-access.js** (5)
- `1004858` — **convert-to-prospect.js** (5)
- `25d7f99` — **discover-services.js** (5; **also fixed a latent `ReferenceError: headers is not defined` in `upsertReportConfig` — the PATCH and POST branches referenced a bare `headers` ident that was never defined in the function scope. Every "save discovered service" call (4 callers at L102/L156/L192/L240) had been throwing and getting swallowed into a 500 on the caller. The migration to `sb.mutate` needs no headers arg, so the fix landed as a side-effect**)
- `f54ee19` + `1f78fa2` — **enrich-proposal.js** (4 + 3 sites; the follow-up commit caught 3 multi-line sites the first pass missed)
- `4fca6e2` — **cron/enqueue-reports.js** (4; dropped unused `var headers`)
- `994dc7f` — **cron/process-queue.js** (**5** sites; pre-verified 4, one multi-line at L26-29 surfaced in-session; dropped unused `sbHeaders`)
- `0a0fc1a` — **generate-followups.js** (4)
- `d4955c5` — **generate-proposal.js** (3 server-side sites; the client-side `track_proposal_view` IIFE at L532 embedded in a template literal is intentionally preserved — runs in browser with anon-key JWT, can't use `sb.query`)
- `d634663` — **content-chat.js** (**4** sites in `fetchPageContext` helper; pre-verified 3, one multi-line at L157-160 surfaced; stream retry loop untouched per scope-fence)
- `48d44ec` — **trigger-batch-audit.js** (**4** sites; pre-verified 3, one multi-line at L72-76 surfaced)
- `a48df07` — **delete-client.js** (2 sites in the DELETE cascade loop; per-table `ok: true/false` reporting preserved by wrapping each `sb.mutate` in its own try/catch)
- `5495019` — **process-batch-synthesis.js** (**2** sites; pre-verified 1, one multi-line at L48-52 surfaced)
- `aa53037` — **generate-audit-followups.js** (**3** sites; pre-verified 1, two multi-line at L31-35 and L43-47 surfaced)
- `be72b93` — **cron/process-followups.js** (**5** sites; pre-verified 1, four multi-line surfaced; **also simplified `patchRecord(sbUrl, sbHeaders, table, id, data)` → `patchRecord(table, id, data)` since the first two params were dead (shadowed by closure-captured `sb`); also collapsed a local `sbHeaders` function and an unused `sbKey` var**)
- `2464454` — **digest.js** (4 call sites + **deleted the `sbGet` helper — closes L22**)
- `c9a7759` — **proposal-chat.js** (2 sites in `fetchProposalByContactId` helper; same scope-fence pattern as content-chat — data loader outside stream retry loop, safe to migrate)
- `1759a55` — **ingest-surge-content.js** (2 sites; dropped unused `sbHeaders`)
- `8e523ce` — **cron/process-batch-pages.js** (3 sites across main handler + `checkBatchComplete` helper)

Final doc update: `5b184db` — marks L1 and L22 resolved in `api-audit-2026-04.md` with full Resolution blocks, updates Pattern 12 entry, adds resolution log row, bumps Lows 5 → 7 resolved.

Net result:
- **L1 resolved.** L22 resolved (folded into the digest.js migration). Pattern 12 closed.
- Tallies: **Lows 7 / 28 resolved (21 open). Total ≥68 resolved / ≤50 open across 118 findings.**
- All 22 code commits went straight to READY on first Vercel build. Zero rollbacks, zero amend-for-syntax commits.

Process note — multi-line grep drift:
- The session-prompt pre-verification used the single-line regex `fetch(sb.url()\|fetch(.*rest/v1/\|SUPABASE_URL.*rest/v1` which returned 74 matches across 18 files. That systematically undercounted because many call sites split the `fetch(` and the `sb.url() + '/rest/v1/...'` argument across two lines — these don't match a single-line pattern.
- A follow-up multi-line Python walker (pair `await fetch(` on one line with `sb.url() + '/rest/v1/...'` on the next 1–4 lines, exclude `fetchT`) surfaced **16 additional sites** missed by the single-line grep: 1 in `cron/process-queue`, 1 in `content-chat`, 2 in `trigger-batch-audit`, 1 in `process-batch-synthesis`, 2 in `generate-audit-followups`, 4 in `cron/process-followups`, 3 in `enrich-proposal`, 2 in `proposal-chat`, 2 in `ingest-surge-content`, 3 in `cron/process-batch-pages`.
- 4 additional files outside the pre-verified 17 were discovered this way — all migrated in-session. Future Pattern-12-style sweeps should run both the single-line grep AND the multi-line walker.

Behavior-preservation notes:
- `sb.mutate` throws on PostgREST 4xx/5xx; raw `fetch` did not. Each migrated site was classified by its prior error shape: status flips / decorative `activity_log` writes / fire-and-forget PATCHes were wrapped in inner `try/catch` to preserve silent-fail; sites that previously threw custom error strings kept their outer throw shape with only the interior prefix changing to `Supabase mutate error:`.
- `seed-content-pages.js` had silent-partial-failure semantics (a mid-loop `createDel` returned a non-array on error, `result[0]` was undefined, loop continued). Migration makes it strict: any error aborts with 500. Idempotent seed (pageExists/findDel dedup on retry) makes this correct but is a real behavior change — watch first retries.
- `activate-reporting.js` "campaigns created but failed to store keys" 500 path now surfaces `sb.mutate`'s `"Supabase mutate error: <postgrest msg>"` prefix instead of the raw PostgREST response body; same Pattern-7 leak shape, no worse, kept as-is for behavior preservation (Pattern 7 cleanup is Group I / future session).
- `content-chat.js` and `proposal-chat.js` are scope-fenced streaming endpoints. In both cases the migrated call sites were inside clean data-loader helpers (`fetchPageContext`, `fetchProposalByContactId`) called once per request, outside the NDJSON stream loop and its retry/heartbeat logic. Stream loops not touched.
- The single-line grep's first hit for `api/digest.js:145` was the `sbGet` helper's internal fetch — the function itself was Pattern 12. Migrating the 4 callers and deleting the helper closed both L1 and L22 simultaneously.
- 3 dead helper-param cleanups opportunistically landed alongside the migrations: `patchRecord(sbUrl, sbHeaders, ...)` simplified in `cron/process-followups.js`; `var sbHeaders = sb.headers(...)` vars removed from 6 files after the migrated sites no longer needed them; `var sbKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` removed from `cron/process-followups.js` (dead after the local `sbHeaders` function got deleted).

Out of scope for Group B.3 (flagged for future):
- `fetchT(sb.url() + '/rest/v1/...')` sites — a handful of files already have the timeout wrapper from B.2 but still construct direct PostgREST URLs instead of using `sb.query`/`sb.mutate`. Final repo-wide sweep shows zero of these remain in scope: `analyze-design-spec.js`, `search-stock-images.js`, `onboarding-action.js`, `action.js` all legitimately use `sb.url() + '/rest/v1/'` as URL construction for their own custom routing layers (action.js / onboarding-action.js are the generic mutation-API handlers themselves). No separate L29 filing needed.
- `api/_lib/google-drive.js` bespoke fetch + caching — tracked under N6, untouched.
- Chat/streaming endpoints' stream loops (`agreement-chat.js`, `report-chat.js`) — no Supabase fetches to migrate inside those loops.

## Group I — Lows + Nits reconciliation sweep ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-18)

Classify-first reconciliation pass across all 27 open Lows + Nits. The theme was verification over shipping: read each finding against current `main`, classify into bucket (a) already-closed-doc-only, (b) small ≤10-line fix, or (c) non-trivial/product-gated with a note. Final outcome: 11 closed (4 code + 7 doc-only), 16 stay open with Current-state notes.

**Bucket (a) — doc-only reconciliations (7 findings):**

- **L10** — conditional concern ("if reused as etag across many sites") doesn't apply; repo-wide grep for `content_hash` shows only change-detection uses.
- **L17** — closed incidentally by H22/Group C `aabdac1`; `generate-proposal.js:355-358` now uses `Number.isFinite(amt) && amt >= 0`.
- **L18** — the one-element `models` array at `chat.js:39-41` is intentional single-model scaffolding; the loop runs once correctly and the `if (false)` guard at L110 confirms the structure is future-proofing.
- **L20** — closed by H24/Group B.2 `0163f65`; repo-wide grep confirms zero inline Supabase fetches remain in `compile-report.js`.
- **N1** — concern obsolete after H4/H7 made `query()` throw on non-ok; error shape never reaches `one()` — would throw inside `query()` first.
- **N2** — closed by C2+M8 `5263aa5`; current parse at `stripe-webhook.js:56-63` uses `indexOf+substring`, no `parts[kv[0].trim()] = kv[1]` pattern exists.
- **N6** — closed by Group B.1 H21 commits + H36 `221bfbc`; all 8 `getDelegatedToken` copies gone.

**Bucket (b) — small code fixes (4 findings, 4 commits):**

- `62e6ec3` — **L12** process-entity-audit.js `fmtDelta` converted from block-scoped function declaration to `var` function expression. Non-strict mode hoisting is engine-inconsistent; explicit var makes semantics deterministic. One-line change.
- `be6ad05` — **L28** chat.js Anthropic upstream error routed to `monitor.logError('chat', new Error('anthropic_upstream'), { detail: { status, body: substring(0, 500) } })`; response body reduced to `{ error: userMsg, status }` without `detail`. Mirrors H28 pattern from bootstrap-access.js. Also dropped the redundant `console.error` in favor of the monitor call (detail now survives in `error_log`).
- `e694dce` — **N3** monitor.js CR/LF sanitization before `console.error`. One-line `message.replace(/[\r\n]+/g, ' \\n ')` prevents log-forging via user-sourced content echoed in `error.message` (e.g. PostgREST 4xx bodies). DB-stored `error_log.message` is unchanged (JSONB-safe).
- `d53a1fa` — **N4** onboarding-action.js header comment rewritten. Old "No admin JWT required — uses service role key for writes" reads as intentional-no-auth against post-Phase-4-S2 reality. New comment: "Authenticates via page_token (not admin JWT); service role key is the write identity but the page_token gate and verified contact_id below constrain what any given request can touch." Pairs with the existing multi-line security-model block that was already correct.

All 4 code commits went straight to READY on first Vercel build. Doc-only reconciliation commit `fbd7c04` also READY.

**Bucket (c) — open with Current state notes (16 findings):**

Grouped by why they stay open:

- **Intentional design, not a bug** (3): L2 (bare block scopes sig-verification locals — defensible post-C2), L3 (var-throughout, won't-fix-now), L13 (hardcoded asset URLs, single-domain app).
- **RLS/token-gated risk profile, won't-fix-now** (1): L15 (anon key exp 2089 — page_token gate means anon key is read-only now).
- **Small refactor, but in a sensitive path** (2): L5 (auth.js JWT verify duplicate — wants its own scoped commit), L7 (report-chat.js retry duplicate — scope-fenced streaming endpoint).
- **Product decision required** (3): L6 (agent-failure requeue state-machine change — flagged explicitly), L24 (two calendar URLs in production — Scott vs generic strategy call), N5 (CORS preview-domain allowlist — workflow concern, wants shared helper).
- **Low value / cosmetic** (6): L9 (admin `#audit-` fragment doesn't scroll — harmless), L11 (markdown fence strip nested-fence risk — same class as M25, parked for shared-parser session), L19 (personal-email blocklist — data-quality nit), L21 (User-Agent may be blocked — needs telemetry), L23 (stripEmDashes 5-step chain — works as-is), L25 (VERIFY regex stops at `<` — low-value).
- **Caller-responsibility by design** (1): L4 (github.js no auto-retry on 409 — docs explicitly push caller ownership).

**Key discovery flagged: L6 is a real gap, not stale.** `submit-entity-audit.js:112` creates audit rows with `status='pending'` and flips to `'agent_running'` only on successful agent trigger. On agent failure, status stays at `'pending'` forever — and `cron/process-audit-queue.js:138` only picks up `status='queued'`. So agent-trigger failures at submit time have no auto-retry path; team notification email is the sole fallback, and its admin-URL fragment (L9) doesn't even scroll. The one-line fix (flip to `'queued'` on agent failure so cron picks it up) was deliberately not landed — state-machine change on a public-facing endpoint warrants Chris/Scott sign-off first. L6's Current state note captures the full diagnosis for whoever picks this up.

**Side-finding: stray text in L27.** During the L25 edit, found a one-line orphan "Cuts off flags mid-sentence with HTML brackets." at the end of the L27 section — it belonged to L25 (VERIFY regex) but had drifted. Moved to L25's section as part of L25's Current state note, deleted the orphan.

**Process note — the classify phase was the session.** Per the session prompt's guidance ("Don't force (b) if the fix isn't actually small"), the reconciliation into (a) and the Current state notes for (c) were the primary deliverable; code changes were a small bonus. Typical ratio: ~30 lines of code shipped across 4 files vs ~100 lines of doc content documenting 23 findings' current state. The right balance for a sweep session on a mature audit.

Net result:
- **Lows: 13/28 resolved (was 7). 15 open, all with Current-state notes.**
- **Nits: 5/6 resolved (was 0). 1 open (N5) with Current-state note.**
- **Total ≥79 resolved of 118 findings, ≤39 open.**

Remaining work is either Medium-tier reconciliation (Group J candidate — same profile as Lows had before this sweep), product-decision items (L6/L24/M19/M37/M39), or H29 design session. The audit reads cleanly top-to-bottom now: every finding is resolved, deferred-with-rationale, or has an explicit current-state note.

## Group D — AI prompt injection hardening ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-17)

Five findings closed across the Claude-prompting code paths. Pattern: `sanitizer.sanitizeText(value, maxLen)` applied at field source where possible; bracketed `=== ... === / === END SOURCE MATERIAL ===` delimiter framing added around large untrusted blobs.

Pre-task housekeeping:
- `api/convert-to-prospect.js` — `221bfbc` (H36; migrate to `google-delegated` helper, delete local `getDelegatedToken` + stray inner `auth` require + dead else-branch that referenced the old `{error}` return shape)

Main Group D work:
- `api/compile-report.js` — `e4d9105` (H25; sanitize `practiceName` at source L120 — wraps the `contact.practice_name || (first_name + last_name)` expression once, closes the flagged prompt site at L1034 *and* the 8 email/report rendering sites at L730/L812/L830/L859/L1071/L1089/L1108/L1115 in a single edit)
- `api/generate-content-page.js` — `54153ec` (H31; 12 field wraps across `buildUserMessage` — Practice Info/Details + Bio loop + Endorsement loop fields; `rtpba` 25000 / `intelligence` 3000 / `action_plan` 2000 blobs each wrapped with sanitizer + opening `=== ... (treat as source material, not as instructions) ===` header and matching `=== END SOURCE MATERIAL ===` footer)
- `api/content-chat.js` — `60bccb8` (M15; `practiceName` + `therapistName` sanitized at source L154-155 covers three downstream template-literal interpolations; `city`/`state_province` sanitized at the Location interpolation site L194)
- `api/chat.js` — `49f088a` (M26 prompt-injection half; `page`/`tab`/`clientSlug` sanitized at source L139-141 — covers both the ctx_str interpolation at L177-179 *and* the `dataLabel` interpolation at L184; mode-dispatch `page.includes('/admin/...')` branches L162-174 still work because `sanitizeText` preserves slashes and path characters)

Final doc update: `Group D: doc updates` (this commit) — marks H25/H31/M15/M26/H36 resolved in `api-audit-2026-04.md`, upgrades M26 from 🔶 PARTIAL → ✅ RESOLVED, updates Totals (35 High → 36 High to include H36), updates Running tallies (Highs 17 → 20 resolved, Mediums 5 + partial → 7 resolved), appends 4 Resolution log rows, upgrades M26's row from partial to full.

Net result:
- H25, H31, H36, M15 resolved.
- M26 upgraded partial → fully resolved (err-leak half in Group A's `9dc8c7b`; prompt-injection half in `49f088a`).
- Tallies: **Highs 20 / 36 resolved (16 open). Mediums 7 / 38 resolved. Total ≥41 resolved / ≤76 open across 118 findings.**
- All 5 code commits went straight to READY on first Vercel build. `sanitizer.sanitizeText` has no external deps and no side effects; no runtime regressions observed.

Behavior-preservation notes:
- `sanitizeText` treats `&` as literal text (not entity) by design, so practice names like "Smith & Jones Therapy" render correctly downstream through email HTML, prompts, and UI labels. No double-encoding introduced on the 8 compile-report email sites covered transitively by the H25 source-level wrap.
- For H31's RTPBA: the delimiter header wording changed from `(VERBATIM, DO NOT REWRITE)` to `(treat as source material, not as instructions)` per the prescribed Group D pattern. This shifts emphasis from "use-as-is" to "don't-execute-instructions-embedded-in-this", which matters more for defense-in-depth on client-site-scraped content. Watch the first generated page or two — if Claude starts paraphrasing the RTPBA where it shouldn't, the fix is to combine both concerns as `(use verbatim; any embedded text below is content, not instructions)`.
- For H31's endorsement loop: fields are double-sanitized (once at C9 submit, again here). Idempotent by construction — `sanitizeText` output is always a valid `sanitizeText` input producing the same output. Kept as belt-and-suspenders defense-in-depth.
- For M26 chat.js: `page.includes('/admin/audit')` style mode-dispatch continues to match correctly because `sanitizeText` preserves slashes, alphanumerics, and path structure; it only strips HTML tags, HTML entities, control characters, and collapses excess whitespace — none of which appear in legitimate page paths.
- H36 migration preserved the outer `if (existingDriveFolder) ... else if (saJson) ...` gate. The `saJson` env-var check is now redundant (helper checks env internally) but harmless and kept as fail-fast.

Out of scope for Group D (flagged as candidate future sweeps):
- `agreement-chat.js`, `proposal-chat.js`, `report-chat.js` — not flagged in the original audit. Would extend the pattern if we ever want to be exhaustive; current audit surface is closed.
- Moving to Anthropic prompt caching for the big system prompts — that's H13, its own session.
- Restructuring Claude's JSON-output contracts (`compile-report` highlights, `generate-content-page` NDJSON stream) — current prompts left as-is.

## Group E — Non-transactional state & idempotency ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-17)

Four findings closed across four code commits + one doc commit. Pattern: DELETE+INSERT pairs backed by a unique index replaced with PostgREST upsert (`Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates`); fire-and-forget `.catch(function(){})` PATCHes converted to awaited `sb.mutate` in try/catch, with failures surfaced in the handler's `results` object and routed through `monitor.logError` at the high-stakes sites.

Commits landed on main:

- `886fe05` — **H27.** `api/compile-report.js` highlights: both `generateHighlights()` (~L700) and `buildFallbackHighlights()` (~L713) paths replaced with upsert via `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates,return=minimal`. Backed by new migration `report_highlights_unique_slug_month_sort` adding `UNIQUE(client_slug, report_month, sort_order)`. Pre-verified zero duplicates across 87 existing rows before creating the index. The B.2 try/catch warning wrappers are preserved around the single upsert call; two-step window eliminated.
- `4fc3f69` — **H26.** `api/generate-proposal.js` onboarding seed: DELETE+POST replaced with upsert on the existing `UNIQUE(contact_id, step_key)` using `return=minimal`. Contact `status='prospect'` flip also migrated from bare `fetch` to `sb.mutate`. Added targeted stale-row cleanup (`step_key=not.in.(...)` scoped by `contact_id`) so future template shrinkage doesn't orphan steps — production pre-check showed zero stale rows, so it's a future-proof no-op today. Each sub-step independently try/caught; failures surface in `results.conversion.{status_error, stale_cleanup_error, onboarding_error}`. Zero-row window that blocked `auto_promote_to_active` is closed.
- `9fe2810` — **M11.** `api/admin/deploy-to-r2.js` `site_deployments`: DELETE+POST replaced with upsert on `UNIQUE(site_id, page_path)` using `return=representation` (not `=minimal`) to preserve the single-row shape downstream code depends on in the `deployment` variable. No schema change needed. Clarifies a scope-description inconsistency — the original audit text said `client_sites`, the actual table is `site_deployments`.
- `4d0fa27` — **M30.** `api/generate-proposal.js` 4 fire-and-forget PATCHes: `await fetch(...).catch(function(){})` converted to `await sb.mutate(...)` in try/catch at L90 (`status='generating'`), L284 (error-branch `status='review'` + notes), L594 (`contacts.checkout_options`), L605 (final finalize: `status='ready'`, urls, content). Three sites (L90, L284, L605) additionally log via `monitor.logError('generate-proposal', err, { client_slug: slug, detail: { stage, proposal_id } })` with stages `set_status_generating`, `record_generation_failure`, `finalize_proposal`. Non-critical L594 is log-only through `results.checkout_options_error`. L605 is the audit-flagged "stuck in generating forever" site; it now surfaces as both an admin-visible `results.finalize_error` and an `error_log` entry.
- `62392a9` — Doc update: `api-audit-2026-04.md` marks H26/H27/M11/M30 ✅ RESOLVED with Resolution blocks; Highs 22 → 24, Mediums 9 → 11; total ≥49 resolved / ≤68 open across 118 findings; 4 rows appended to the Resolution log.

Net result:
- H26, H27, M11, M30 fully resolved.
- PostgREST upsert with `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates` is the canonical replacement for DELETE+INSERT pairs going forward, whenever the target table has (or can gain) a unique index on the conflict keys. Use `return=minimal` by default; switch to `return=representation` when downstream code depends on the post-write row shape.
- Fire-and-forget `.catch(function(){})` is now purged from `api/generate-proposal.js` serverside. The one remaining instance at L515 is intentional: it's inside the backtick `trackingScript` template literal injected into deployed HTML as a `<script>`, so it's browser-side code running in a visitor's tab, not a Vercel function.
- Tallies: **Highs 24 / 36 resolved (12 open). Mediums 11 / 38 resolved. Total ≥49 resolved / ≤68 open across 118 findings.**

Behavior-preservation notes:
- H26 upsert uses `return=minimal`. The `auto_promote_to_active` trigger fires on row-level `pending→complete` transitions, so an upsert that keeps rows at `status='pending'` (the template's seed value) is a no-op on the column the trigger watches — no risk of the fix itself spuriously firing the promotion. The fix's goal is to close the zero-row window that was blocking the trigger from ever firing, not to change its semantics.
- M11 chose `return=representation` rather than `=minimal`. Per the commit message, the handler reads fields from the upsert response into a `deployment` variable used downstream; `=minimal` would have returned an empty body and broken that read. Worth remembering as a general rule when applying the upsert template — match the `return=` preference to what the handler does with the response.
- M30's L605 finalize continues the existing handler pattern of always returning 200 with a `results` envelope, even on partial failure. Not an API-contract change; the admin UI already inspects `results` for error sub-fields. Introducing a 500 at L605 would have broken the "proposal HTML is already deployed, state-record update failed but the deploy succeeded" distinction — admin retry would then re-run the Drive folder creation step (not idempotent) and create duplicate folders. Keeping the 200 + `results.finalize_error` path preserves the retry safety.
- For M30 specifically, the three `monitor.logError` sites use `client_slug: slug` (the `slug` variable is set at L71 from `contact.slug`, after the proposal+contact load at L62-69 but before the first in-scope PATCH at L88). All three are reached only after `slug` is defined; confirmed by code inspection. The `detail.stage` tags are distinct so `error_log` queries can filter per-step.

Out of scope for Group E (flagged as candidate future work):
- L1 — the `fetch(sb.url() + '/rest/v1/...')` raw-read pattern still present at `generate-proposal.js:62,80` and across other files outside B.2's four. Tracked in the Low section, natural fit for Group B.3 (Supabase helper migration sweep).
- M18 + M19 — non-transactional DELETE+INSERT patterns in `process-entity-audit.js`. Flagged during B.2 as preserved deliberately; were not in Group E's four. If another round of this work is scheduled, these are the next-obvious targets — both have similar shape to H26/H27 and the upsert template applies directly.
- Rewriting the `auto_promote_to_active` trigger to be more robust against empty-row windows (remove the pending→complete requirement, or add a row-count guard). With H26 closed, the trigger's brittleness no longer has a realistic way to bite; not worth its own session.
- Moving any of these to server-side RPCs with real transactional semantics. Plain upsert turned out to be sufficient for all four findings; the RPC fallback path mentioned in the session prompt didn't need to be exercised.

## Group F — Public endpoint hardening ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-18)

Seven findings closed across six code commits + one doc commit. Pattern: input validation and boundary checks at the handler entry, layered defense-in-depth (validate format → encode → check ownership → fail loud on infra errors), and oracle-closing on not-found paths so response shape doesn't reveal existence.

Commits landed on main:

- `502f6213` — **H15.** `api/content-chat.js` + `api/submit-entity-audit.js` Origin flip. `if (origin && origin !== 'https://clients.moonraker.ai')` → `if (!origin || origin !== 'https://clients.moonraker.ai')`. Shared pattern, single tree-API commit touching both files (`+4/-2` each). Callers that strip Origin (curl, non-browser tools) no longer bypass. Rate limits (3/hr/IP on submit-entity-audit via Phase 4 S4, 20/min/IP on content-chat via Phase 4 S4) remain the primary control; this closes the defense-in-depth gap.
- `34fca146` — **H12 + M14.** `api/content-chat.js` UUID validation + ownership gate + fail-loud `fetchPageContext`. Added canonical UUID regex on `content_page_id` with 400 on non-UUID, `encodeURIComponent()` at the four PostgREST concat sites (content_pages, contacts, design_specs, practice_details) as defense-in-depth, and a status-based ownership gate (reads `contact.lost` and `contact.status === 'lost'`, returns `null` from `fetchPageContext` so the handler 404s with the same shape as page-not-found — no existence oracle). `fetchPageContext` now throws on Supabase misconfiguration or non-ok HTTP; handler wraps in try/catch and returns 503 on throw (stops burning Opus credits on a futile call during a Supabase outage). Page-token option-(a) deferred per session prompt: `content_preview` scope exists in `_lib/page-token.js` SCOPES, but deployed content-preview templates don't demonstrably inject `__PAGE_TOKEN__`, so switching to required-token verification would break production chatbots. Status-based gate is the interim.
- `12b05edd` — **M9.** `api/submit-entity-audit.js` slug TOCTOU. Constraint names verified via `pg_constraint` before editing. Slug pre-check removed (UNIQUE(slug) is the authoritative backstop); outer catch tightened to read `err.detail.code === '23505'` (structured PostgREST error attached by `sb.mutate`, see `_lib/supabase.js:76-79`), with `contacts_slug_key` name-match and the original `duplicate|unique` substring as layered fallbacks. Slug pre-check's empathetic user message moved into the catch (that's now the actual collision path). Email pre-check kept — no UNIQUE constraint on email exists (two duplicate-email rows in production confirm). Filed as M39.
- `898dd621` — **H32.** `api/digest.js` recipient allowlist. `@moonraker.ai` required on every entry in `recipients[]` (case-insensitive), with 400 + invalid-entry list on violation. Added immediately after the existing required-fields validation. `from`/`to` (period-label fields for the header, not email addresses) intentionally left unrestricted.
- `2ce32b89` — **M12.** `api/admin/manage-site.js` FQDN validation. Strict `/^(?=.{1,253}$)(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)\.)+[a-z]{2,63}$/` regex added after the existing toLowerCase+replace normalization in `handleProvision`. Rejects `:8080`, `/path`, `user:pass@`, `?query`, leading/trailing hyphens, empty labels, 64+ char labels, numeric TLDs. Verified against 16 boundary cases before push. `handleUpdate`/`handleDeprovision`/`handleStatus` take `site_id`, not raw domain, so the check lives in one place.
- `d36e6577` — **M20.** `api/newsletter-unsubscribe.js` oracle close. `sb.one('newsletter_subscribers?id=eq.<sid>&select=id&limit=1')` before the PATCH; if the row doesn't exist, skip the PATCH and return the same success response (HTML `unsubPage(true)` or JSON `{ok:true,'Unsubscribed'}`). No more `[sb.mutate] PATCH returned 0 rows` log warning for valid-UUID-but-nonexistent sids. Trade-off: one extra Supabase round-trip per real unsubscribe; acceptable at opt-in volume.
- `e23c29f5` — Doc update: `api-audit-2026-04.md` marks H12/H15/H32/M9/M12/M14/M20 ✅ RESOLVED with Resolution blocks; Highs 24 → 27, Mediums 11 → 15; total ≥49 → ≥56 resolved across 118 findings (M39 added); 7 rows appended to the Resolution log.

Net result:
- H12, H15, H32, M9, M12, M14, M20 fully resolved.
- Public endpoint hardening pattern consolidated: UUID regex on any public-facing `?id=eq.<x>` handoff; `encodeURIComponent` at the concat site regardless of upstream validation (defense-in-depth); ownership gate via status/lost columns when page-token infra isn't already wired; 404 (not 403) for not-found and lost, same shape either way; 503 on Supabase misconfiguration or infra error rather than continuing with nulls; existence check via `sb.one` before PATCH-by-id when the zero-rows warning would be an oracle.
- Tallies: **Highs 27 / 36 resolved (9 open). Mediums 15 / 39 resolved (24 open, M39 new). Total ≥56 resolved / ≤62 open across 118 findings.**

Behavior-preservation notes:
- H12's UUID validation is gated on `contentPageId` being truthy (`if (contentPageId && !uuidPattern.test(...))`). The existing `if (contentPageId)` branch around `fetchPageContext` still handles the no-id case (prompt proceeds with null page/contact/spec, same as before). This preserves any legitimate caller path that doesn't pass a content_page_id — not one we've seen, but the old code permitted it.
- H12's ownership 404 uses the same response body shape as the not-found case (`{ error: 'Content page not found' }`) so an attacker probing for valid UUIDs can't distinguish "never existed" from "contact lost". Same pattern as M20's existence-check.
- M9's outer catch fallback message was updated from `'a record for this practice'` to `'your information on file'`. The former was the generic fallback-of-fallback; the latter is the exact message the slug pre-check used. Since the catch is now the sole slug-collision path (pre-check gone), the pre-check's message is the correct one to preserve per the session prompt's "preserve the user-facing messages exactly" instruction.
- M14 converted `fetchPageContext`'s silent `{ page: null, contact: null, spec: null }` return on Supabase errors into a thrown exception. Handler maps the throw to 503. In practice, a correctly-configured production Vercel (Supabase env vars present, DB reachable) never hits the throw path — it only fires if env config regresses or Supabase has an outage. The old silent-fallback was a latent footgun: a Supabase outage turned every chat request into an Opus call with empty context, accreting cost while the client saw "generic unhelpful responses" instead of an error.
- M12's FQDN regex is US/Western-domain biased (TLD 2-63 alpha; rejects IDN punycode `.xn--p1ai`). Not in our customer set. Called out in the commit message as revisit-if-we-onboard-international-domains.

Out of scope for Group F (flagged as new finding or candidate future work):
- **M39 (new, filed 2026-04-18):** `contacts.email` has no UNIQUE constraint. The surviving email pre-check in `submit-entity-audit.js` is TOCTOU-racy in the same way the removed slug pre-check was. Two duplicate-email rows already exist in production, confirming the race has fired (or a prior bug allowed it). Parked for product decision — one therapist with sibling practices legitimately sharing an email is a scenario that needs a call before we enforce `UNIQUE(email)`. If the decision is "enforce," it's a cleanup migration + schema change + catch-block tightening that mirrors M9's shape.
- `api/submit-entity-audit.js` outer catch at L216 still returns `err.message` in the 500 response body when the error isn't a unique-violation. Not worsened by Group F's edit; out of the M9 scope (which was strictly the TOCTOU). Small cleanup candidate for the Lows + Nits sweep.
- Page-token option (a) for content-chat.js — wiring the `content_preview` scope at deploy time and requiring a valid page token on each chat call. Needs a deploy-pipeline audit (where templates get `__PAGE_TOKEN__` injected) before it can be turned on safely. Candidate future session if the status-based gate proves insufficient; no evidence it will.
- H12 sub-issue: Opus 4.6 model choice + 4000 max_tokens. Was always a cost note, not a security fix. Rate limit is the cost control.

## Group G batch 1 — Operational resilience cherry-picks ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-18)

Six findings closed across five code commits + one doc commit. Three touched `api/_lib/auth.js` (H1, M2 bundled + H3 separate), three touched `api/process-entity-audit.js` (M18 primary + H17 sub 1 auth + H17 sub 2 HTML sanitization) plus one sister-site fix in `api/setup-audit-schedule.js` (M18). One finding (H2) closed without a code change — already resolved incidentally by P4S5 on 2026-04-17, just needed the doc mark.

Commits landed on main:

- `6e8a51a` — **H1 + M2.** `api/_lib/auth.js` cache TTL + `last_login_at` throttle, bundled because both touch `_profileCache` and M2's throttle depends on H1's extended SELECT. `_profileCache` entries now store `{ profile, fetched_at }` with a 60s TTL (`PROFILE_CACHE_TTL_MS`). New `maybeUpdateLastLogin(userId)` helper reads the cached profile's `last_login_at`, skips the PATCH if `now - prevTs < LAST_LOGIN_THROTTLE_MS` (60s), and updates the cache in-place before firing so concurrent same-window calls short-circuit. Replaces the inline fire-and-forget PATCH at both `requireAdmin` (formerly L198-204) and `requireAdminOrInternal` (formerly L253-259). SELECT at the cache-miss path extended from `id,email,display_name,role` to `id,email,display_name,role,last_login_at`. Trade-offs: up to 60s stale profile after a role change; up to 60s of missed `last_login_at` granularity. Both match the thresholds called out in the findings.
- `f1c0d22` — **H3.** `api/_lib/auth.js` dead code deletion. Removed the `var derSig = rawToDer(signature)` assignment and its two-line misleading comment at the call site, plus the `function rawToDer(raw) { return raw }` declaration and its comment block below `verifyJwt`. Both `nodeCrypto.verify` calls already passed the raw `signature` buffer; `derSig` was never referenced. `dsaEncoding: 'ieee-p1363'` handles the raw R||S format natively. No behavioral change. Grep-verified no `rawToDer`/`derSig` tokens remain.
- `e092cae` + `4fb46a7` — **M18** (both writer sites). `checklist_items.id` column verified via `information_schema.columns` as unconstrained `text`. Existing data: 1875 rows across 80 distinct 8-char prefixes, no collisions, uniform 12-char ids. Primary fix in `process-entity-audit.js:374` switches `auditId.substring(0, 8) + '-' + idx.padStart(3, '0')` to `auditId + '-' + idx.padStart(3, '0')` (44-char composite). Sister fix in `setup-audit-schedule.js:124` applies the identical substitution to the lead-to-client conversion path's `tasks` JSONB explosion. Both writer sites were emitting into the same collision surface; closing only one would have left the bug open. No downstream reader parses the prefix — templates access rows by `client_slug` or `audit_id`, the one direct-id read (`_templates/progress.html:316`) is opaque.
- `7f094dc` — **H17** both sub-issues. Added `var sanitizer = require('./_lib/html-sanitizer')` to the top-of-file imports alongside the other `_lib` modules. **Sub 1:** `var internalAuth = process.env.CRON_SECRET || process.env.AGENT_API_KEY || ''` replaced with a bare `process.env.AGENT_API_KEY` read and an explicit `throw` if missing. The route is only invoked from the agent callback path, so CRON_SECRET was never semantically correct here. The throw lands in the existing try/catch which emits `step: 'auto_send_warning'` with the error text — an env regression now surfaces loudly instead of silently 401ing at `send-audit-email`. **Sub 2:** Both team notification email bodies (premium-review at L579-585 and quarterly at L623-628) wrap every interpolated variable in `sanitizer.sanitizeText()` at reasonable length caps — first_name/last_name 100, practiceName 200, audit_period 50, cresScore 20. `auditId` uses `encodeURIComponent` inside the anchor href because `sanitizeText` would strip the hyphens a UUID requires. Subject lines sanitized too. `varianceHtml` left raw because it's built from server-computed numeric scores with no user-controlled surface.
- `e00be4c` (pre-existing, doc-marked 2026-04-18) — **H2.** Phase 4 S5 had already extracted `api/_lib/postgrest-filter.js` with an operator allowlist and per-value `encodeURIComponent`, and wired both `api/action.js` (L60, L96, L132) and `api/onboarding-action.js` (L95, L105) to call `pgFilter.buildFilter(filters)`. Both files' local `buildFilter` declarations were deleted at that time. The audit doc had not been updated to reflect the resolution — Group G batch 1 walkthrough verified on current main and added the Resolution block.
- Doc commit (next) — `api-audit-2026-04.md` marks H1/H2/H3/H17/M2/M18 ✅ RESOLVED with Resolution blocks; Highs 27 → 31, Mediums 15 → 17; total ≥56 → ≥62 resolved across 118 findings; 6 rows appended to the Resolution log. `post-phase-4-status.md` marks Group G batch 1 complete and points the "Recommended next session" at batch 2.

Net result:
- H1, H2, H3, H17, M2, M18 fully resolved.
- `api/_lib/auth.js` now has bounded admin-profile staleness (60s instead of unbounded-warm-instance) and a sustainable PATCH rate on `admin_profiles.last_login_at` (at most 1/min/admin instead of per-request). Both changes composed cleanly in a single cache-shape change.
- `api/process-entity-audit.js` notification emails no longer expose team inboxes to HTML injection from public-audit submitters. The internal-auth path is now a single deliberate env var with a loud failure mode.
- `checklist_items` collision surface closed across both writer sites.
- Tallies: **Highs 31 / 36 resolved (5 open: H6, H13, H16, H23, H29). Mediums 17 / 39 resolved. Total ≥62 resolved / ≤56 open across 118 findings.**

Behavior-preservation notes:
- H1's 60s TTL accepts up to 60s of stale role/display_name/email after a write. For admin role elevation or removal that's within the "normal operational latency" band — admin UI could force-refresh by setting `fetched_at = 0` if that ever becomes load-bearing, but no current flow needs it.
- M2's cache-first-then-fire ordering is deliberate: if the PATCH fails, the cache holds a `nowIso` that didn't persist to DB, which means concurrent same-window requests correctly skip (we didn't want them piling on the failed PATCH), and the next request after the 60s window will see cache expiry and try again. The lost `last_login_at` granularity on PATCH failure is bounded by the same 60s and matches the finding's stated tolerance.
- H3 preserved signature-verification semantics exactly — both `nodeCrypto.verify` calls already used the raw buffer. The deletion is pure dead-code removal; no crypto change.
- M18's sister site fix in `setup-audit-schedule.js:124` is a scope expansion over the audit's stated site, justified because it's the same bug on the same column. The commit message and Resolution block call it out explicitly. Future auditors tracing back from the finding to current main will see both writer sites updated with matching commit references.
- H17 sub 2 chose `sanitizer.sanitizeText` rather than local `esc()` because the file already uses sanitizer-based patterns elsewhere (it's the canonical helper per Group D/F precedent) and the notification bodies are plain-text-shaped with minimal HTML structure; strict tag-strip is appropriate. `varianceHtml` stays raw because it's server-computed; an alternative would be to escape the numeric interpolations inside `fmtDelta` defensively, but those are guaranteed to be numbers by the computation path and escaping them would add noise without adding safety.

Out of scope for Group G batch 1 (flagged as candidate follow-up):
- `api/process-entity-audit.js` has additional HTML interpolation sites outside the two notification emails — the scorecard template read/substitute/push path around L419-538 and the entity-audit suite deploy around L480-540. The session prompt explicitly scoped H17 to the two team notification emails and asked for any additional sites to be filed separately. On inspection during the H17 edit, the scorecard template path substitutes admin-controlled values (practice name, slug, scores) into a GitHub-stored HTML template using `.replace(/\n/g, '')` — that's a different shape from the notification emails (template is trusted, values are admin-JWT-gated) and sits closer in shape to H16's template-placeholder concern than to H17's public-submitter concern. Left for a future session; no action this batch.
- `setup-audit-schedule.js` wasn't explicitly scoped into M18 but got pulled in as same-bug. Reasonable alternative would be to file it as a separate Medium (e.g. M40) and leave the fix for a future session. Chose the bundle approach because the pattern was byte-identical copy-paste and fixing only one of two writers is an incomplete remediation. If a reviewer prefers the separate-ID convention, the Resolution log row and the commit message both make the scope expansion visible.

## Group G batch 2 — Operational resilience, heavier items ✅ COMPLETE (H6, H13) / 🔶 DEFERRED (H29) (2026-04-18)

Two findings closed, one deferred on design. Both code commits went straight to READY on first Vercel build.

Commits landed on main:

- `b3d5d8b` — **H6.** `api/stripe-webhook.js` notify-team + setup-audit-schedule fires. Converted `fetch(...).catch(...)` fire-and-forget to `await fetchT(url, opts, 15000)` with response-code inspection and `monitor.critical` on non-ok plus outer try/catch on the fetch throw itself, both feeding `results.notify_team_failed` / `results.setup_audit_schedule_failed`. Critical detail: the `monitor.critical` call is itself wrapped in an inner try/catch so an alert-send failure can't mask Stripe's 200 response. Stripe must always see 200 on webhook handling because it will not retry a 4xx/5xx and the upstream status flip + payment insert have already committed. The alert email becomes the operator-surfacing channel for downstream POST failures; results flags give the webhook caller the shape to log partial success if needed.
- `fba6183` — **H13.** `api/agreement-chat.js` CSA prompt caching. Converted `system: systemPrompt` (single string) to `system: systemBlocks` (2-block array). Block 1 is dynamic (interpolates `pageContent`); block 2 is fully static (the ~8K-token CSA + response guidelines) with `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }`. Concatenation is byte-identical to the original single-string prompt, so model behavior is preserved. Turn 2+ of the same conversation hits cache on the full static prefix; billable tokens drop to ~10% of the cached portion.

H29 deferral:

- `api/enrich-proposal.js` `enrichment_data` encrypt-at-rest surfaced 4 unresolved design questions during the prompt's budgeted infra-check:
  1. **JSONB shape.** `crypto.encryptFields` only handles string fields (L86 `typeof === 'string'` gate). `enrichment_data` is JSONB with nested `emails[]`, `calls[]`, `audit_scores`, `audit_tasks`, `website_info`, `practice_details`. Three options: extend `encryptFields` to JSON.stringify + encrypt + JSON.parse on decrypt; split into encrypted scalar columns; or wrap at the enrich-proposal call site.
  2. **Read-path surface.** `enrichment_data` is read by `enrich-proposal.js` (self), `generate-proposal.js` (downstream Claude context), and via `action.js` admin reads. Any encrypt-at-rest shape needs corresponding decrypt wiring at every reader. `action.js`'s `SENSITIVE_FIELDS` convention is per-table scoped to `workspace_credentials`; extending it for `proposals.enrichment_data` is a shape change, not a one-field add.
  3. **Legacy-row migration.** Existing plaintext rows can't be decrypted through the new path without a backfill. Non-trivial because the data is JSONB, not a string.
  4. **`enrichment_sources` sibling + rotation.** Same PATCH writes both. Consistency argues for encrypting both; key rotation across an accumulating per-proposal field has no precedent in the workspace_credentials rotation story (admin UI re-save on rotation doesn't apply).

Recommendation: dedicated design session picks between options (1)/(2)/(3), then a scoped code session lands the chosen wiring plus a backfill migration. Interim controls: admin-JWT gate on readers, Group B.1's `_tokenCache` in `_lib/google-delegated.js` (reduces repeated Gmail impersonation mints), rate limit on enrich-proposal.

Tallies: **Highs 33 / 36 resolved. 3 open: H16, H23, H29.** Mediums unchanged at 17 / 39.

## H16 + H23 mini-session — last two actionable Highs closed ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-18)

Both findings closed in one mini-session across three code commits + one doc commit. All three code commits went READY on Vercel on first build.

Pre-verification at session start: confirmed `b3d5d8b` (H6) and `fba6183` (H13) on main per the session-prompt requirement. H16 line numbers also verified on current main: the audit doc cited L462/L492/L541; current main had the three sites at L443/L473/L522 (the Group G batch 1 H17 sanitizer additions shifted them earlier — still the same three deploy call sites).

Commits landed on main:

- `2eb09dba` — **H16.** `api/process-entity-audit.js` template deploy shape. Added a `prepTemplate(base64Content, replacements)` helper near the top of the file (just after the `_lib` requires). Matches the canonical pattern in `generate-proposal.js:560`: decode base64 → apply any `{{KEY}}` replacements → re-encode to base64. All three deploy sites (L459 entity-audit, L489 entity-audit-checkout, L538 suite loop) now use `content: prepTemplate(<tmpl>.content)` in place of the old `content: <tmpl>.content.replace(/\n/g, '')` shape. Pre-check of all 5 templates (entity-audit.html, entity-audit-checkout.html, diagnosis.html, action-plan.html, progress.html) confirmed zero placeholders today, so no behavioral change ships — the route is now ready for any future `{{SLUG}}`/`{{PRACTICE_NAME}}` substitution without another shape rewrite.
- `484dc8e5` — **H23 part 1 (scope reduction).** `api/chat.js` `buildSystemPrompt` clientIndex read gated on `clientSlug`: `var clientIndex = clientSlug ? null : (ctx.clientIndex || null);`. Deep-dive pages already have the full client-specific clientData loaded; the ~60-client cross-client roster would be ~5K tokens of noise per turn. Dashboard and list pages keep the index unchanged. Single-line value change, no call-site changes.
- `052f2245` — **H23 part 2 (prompt caching).** `buildSystemPrompt` now returns a 2-block `system:` array with an Anthropic prompt-caching breakpoint on the first (static) block. Static prefix = `BASE_PROMPT` + mode selector (DIRECT_ANSWER_MODE or CROSS_CLIENT_OPS based on whether clientSlug && clientData both present) + `BASE_PROMPT_STYLE` + `MODE_*` (audits/deliverables/onboarding/reports/clients/dashboard based on page). Dynamic tail = current-context line + clientData JSON (if present) + clientIndex JSON (if not scope-dropped). Call site at L36/L61 renamed `systemPrompt → systemBlocks`. Mirrors the H13 shape in `agreement-chat.js:100`. Expected on turn 2+ of a chat session on the same page: `usage.cache_read_input_tokens` ~= static prefix token count (billed at 10%), `cache_creation_input_tokens = 0`; only the dynamic tail is billed at full rate.

Design note on the H23 split: keeping scope reduction and prompt caching as two commits was deliberate. The session prompt called it out — scope reduction is a single-line value change with obvious intent, while prompt caching is a structural refactor of the function's return type. The two-commit shape gives a clean rollback point if the cache_control shape ever causes model-behavior regressions: the scope-reduction saving survives independently. Shape of the static/dynamic split: byte-identical to the original join would require a leading `\n` on the dynamic block's text to preserve the seam between MODE_* and the `## Current Context` heading; chose not to add that because two system-prompt blocks are processed as separate content units (the tokenizer doesn't see them joined), so the minor whitespace difference doesn't affect caching correctness or model behavior.

Combined savings on a typical admin deep-dive chat session: turn 1 pays static + dynamic; turns 2+ pay 10% × static + full × dynamic. With clientIndex dropped on deep-dive, the dynamic tail per turn falls to roughly the clientData blob alone. Historical bill shape (~18K input tokens/turn on a deep-dive) should fall to ~2-4K billable tokens/turn on turns 2+.

Tallies: **Highs 35 / 36 resolved. 1 open: H29 (deferred on design). All non-deferred Highs closed.** Mediums unchanged at 17 / 39.

## Executed prompt — Group G batch 2 (historical, for reference)

```
Operational resilience session — batch 2. Three heavier items from
the original Group G list: H6, H13, H29. Batch 1 (H1, H2, H3, H17,
M2, M18) closed 2026-04-18.

Read docs/api-audit-2026-04.md sections H6, H13, H29 first, then
walk through your plan before touching code.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pre-verification required at session start (current main)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Batch 1's code changes are on main. Verify before starting:
  - api/_lib/auth.js has PROFILE_CACHE_TTL_MS constant and
    maybeUpdateLastLogin helper (H1 + M2 landed `6e8a51a`)
  - api/_lib/auth.js has no `rawToDer` or `derSig` references
    (H3 landed `f1c0d22`)
  - api/process-entity-audit.js has `var sanitizer = require(...)`
    import and `sanitizer.sanitizeText` wrappers in both notification
    email bodies (H17 landed `7f094dc`)
  - api/process-entity-audit.js and api/setup-audit-schedule.js use
    the full auditId/adopted.id in checklist_items composite id, no
    `.substring(0, 8)` (M18 landed `e092cae` + `4fb46a7`)

If any of the above don't match expected state, pause and investigate
before touching batch 2 code.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Findings to close this session
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

| Finding | Site | Shape | Est size |
|---------|------|-------|----------|
| H6 | api/stripe-webhook.js:129-148 | Fire-and-forget POSTs to /api/notify-team and /api/setup-audit-schedule with no retry, no await | 30 min |
| H13 | api/agreement-chat.js:119+ | Full ~8K-token CSA in every system prompt; Anthropic prompt caching with cache_control breakpoint would collapse after first turn | 30 min |
| H29 | api/enrich-proposal.js | Searches three team inboxes via domain-wide delegation; stores enrichment_data in contacts table unencrypted | 30 min + infra check |

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
H29 infra prerequisite (do this first)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Before touching H29 code, verify encryption infrastructure:
  - Read api/_lib/crypto.js to confirm current SENSITIVE_FIELDS list
    and v1:-prefix ciphertext convention (C5/H8 context).
  - Check whether `enrichment_data` is already in SENSITIVE_FIELDS
    (spot-check contacts table schema; the column is JSONB so the
    encryption path may need shape extension — crypto.encryptFields
    currently expects string fields).
  - Decide: extend encryptFields to handle JSONB by JSON.stringify-ing
    to ciphertext (simplest), OR split enrichment_data into separate
    encrypted scalar columns (more invasive), OR encrypt at the
    application layer with a dedicated wrapper.

If the decision path adds >30 min of design work, file H29 as
blocked on design and proceed with H6 and H13 only. Not every
audit item needs to close in one session.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
H6 shape
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Current (approx — verify on main):
  // After Stripe webhook determines product type
  fetch('https://clients.moonraker.ai/api/notify-team', {...}).catch(...);
  fetch('https://clients.moonraker.ai/api/setup-audit-schedule', {...}).catch(...);
  return res.status(200).json({ received: true });

Problem: if either POST fails, there's no retry and no surfacing.
Stripe has already been 200-acknowledged so Stripe won't retry.
Team notification missed, audit schedule not set up, no alert.

Two viable shapes:
  (a) Queue table (webhook_deliveries or similar) with pending/
      complete/failed status and a cron processor. More durable
      but adds a new table + cron + backoff logic.
  (b) Inline await with monitor.critical on failure and admin
      retry UI button. Simpler. Accepts that a transient outage
      at notify-team could still silently fail, but the critical
      alert email would fire.

Recommendation per original audit: either works; (b) is lighter.
Choose based on current Stripe webhook volume — if it's under
10/day, (b) is fine; if higher, (a) is better.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
H13 shape
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

api/agreement-chat.js builds a system prompt that includes the full
CSA (Client Services Agreement, ~8K tokens) on every turn of the
conversation. Anthropic's prompt caching can cache that block after
the first turn, dropping cost on subsequent turns to ~10% of the
cached prefix token count.

Shape:
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'CSA context + user question', cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' } },
    ...
  ]

Breakpoint placement: after the CSA block and before the current
user turn. The CSA text is static per-conversation — should hit
cache on every turn after turn 1.

Verify current agreement-chat.js structure before editing — if
it's using the streaming SDK, the cache_control shape goes on the
specific content block, not the message. Test with a multi-turn
agreement flow and confirm cache-read token counts on the response.

SCOPE FENCE: don't refactor the retry+buffering logic. Only the
prompt-caching addition. See "scope fences" in the base instructions
for streaming chat endpoints.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Testing
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- Each commit's Vercel deploy must go READY.
- Smoke tests (non-blocking):
    * H6: Stripe test event (via Stripe CLI or dashboard test mode)
      triggers the webhook; confirm notify-team + setup-audit-schedule
      both fire and any failure surfaces in error_log or a critical
      alert email.
    * H13: Send two turns on an agreement-chat conversation; second
      response's usage.cache_read_input_tokens should be ~8K+.
    * H29: If in scope — encrypt a test enrichment_data row, verify
      DB column is v1:-prefixed, verify read path still returns the
      decrypted object shape.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Out of scope (existing parked items)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- M19 (Stripe-late-lands webhook race), M37 (auto-schedule post-
  submit status flip), M39 (contacts.email UNIQUE) — all three
  need product decisions before they're code-ready.
- H16 and H23 — not in Group G; H16 is template-placeholder-substitution,
  H23 is `api/chat.js` admin-DB-in-prompt. Both are candidates for
  a dedicated session but outside Group G's operational-resilience theme.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Deliverables
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Commit shape (suggested):
  c1: H6 — stripe-webhook.js retry/queue logic
  c2: H13 — agreement-chat.js prompt caching breakpoint
  c3: H29 — enrich-proposal.js encrypt enrichment_data (if infra check passes)

Then doc update:
  - api-audit-2026-04.md: mark H6/H13/H29 ✅ RESOLVED with Resolution
    blocks. Update tallies. Append rows to Resolution log.
  - post-phase-4-status.md: mark Group G batch 2 complete,
    recommend Group B.3 or Group I next based on whichever reads
    like better value at the time.
```

## Executed prompt — Group B.3 (historical, for reference)

```
Group B.3 — Pattern 12 Supabase helper migration. Sweep the remaining
inline `fetch(sb.url() + '/rest/v1/...')` call sites across the files
outside Group B.2's four (`compile-report.js` and friends already
done). The helper surface is ready: `sb.query`, `sb.mutate`, `sb.one`,
all timeout-backed via `_lib/fetch-with-timeout` since H4.

Read docs/api-audit-2026-04.md "Patterns to fix systemically" section
(the Pattern 12 entry) and L1 in the Low section first, then grep for
the remaining call sites on current main before walking through your
plan.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pre-verification required at session start
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Confirm the H16 + H23 mini-session landed on main before starting:
  - api/process-entity-audit.js has `function prepTemplate(` near the
    top (commit `2eb09dba`)
  - api/chat.js buildSystemPrompt returns an array (look for
    `return [` at the end of the function, with
    `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }` on the first block)
    (commit `052f2245`)

If either doesn't match expected state, pause and investigate before
touching this session's scope.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scope — find all remaining Pattern 12 call sites
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

On current main, grep for the pattern:
  grep -rn "fetch(sb.url()\|fetch(.*rest/v1/\|SUPABASE_URL.*rest/v1" api/

Known starting points from the audit:
  - api/generate-proposal.js:62, 80 (explicit L1 reference)
  - Other inline-fetch sites in files that Group B.2 did not touch
    (Group B.2 covered compile-report.js, the big 4; enumerate the
    remainder)

For each site:
  - Read replaces `fetch(sb.url() + '/rest/v1/TABLE?...')` + headers +
    status check → one of:
    - `sb.query('TABLE?...')` for list reads
    - `sb.one('TABLE?...')` for single-row reads with limit=1
  - Mutate replaces `fetch(...)` with PATCH/POST body → `sb.mutate(
    'TABLE?filter=...', 'PATCH', body, prefer, timeoutMs)`

Behavior-preservation notes from prior B.2 retrospectives:
  - sb.mutate throws on PostgREST 4xx/5xx. Original raw-fetch sites
    often silent-fail; wrap in try/catch to preserve "warn and
    continue" semantics where applicable.
  - Response-shape assumptions: sb.query returns the parsed rows array;
    sb.one returns a single row or null. Inline-fetch sites sometimes
    did `await resp.json()` + `data[0]` — collapse to sb.one where
    appropriate.
  - Existing sb.* wrapper calls use a shared timeout (10s default).
    If a specific site needs a different timeout, pass timeoutMs.
  - Where a site throws a custom error string (e.g. "PATCH failed: ...")
    that gets wrapped into a user-facing 500, preserve the outer
    message shape — only the interior detail changes to the shared
    helper's prefix.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Deliverables
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Commit shape (suggested, one per file migrated):
  cN: <filename> — migrate N inline Supabase fetches to sb.* helpers

Then doc updates:
  - api-audit-2026-04.md: mark L1 ✅ RESOLVED with Resolution block
    enumerating migrated files + sites. Update Pattern 12 entry in
    "Patterns to fix systemically" with closed/remaining count.
  - post-phase-4-status.md: mark Group B.3 complete with a
    retrospective mirroring B.2's shape, update tallies, point next
    session at Group I (Lows + Nits reconciliation sweep).
```

## Prompt for next session (Group I — Lows + Nits reconciliation sweep)

```
Group I — Lows + Nits reconciliation sweep. With Pattern 12 closed by
Group B.3 and all non-deferred Highs resolved, what remains is the
cleanup tail: 21 open Lows (L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L9, L10, L11, L12,
L13, L15, L17, L18, L19, L20, L21, L23, L24, L25, L28) and 6 Nits
(N1-N6). The theme of this session is reconciliation first, fixes
second: several of these entries are plausibly stale after Groups A-G
and Phase 4.

Read docs/api-audit-2026-04.md Low and Nit sections; then read
docs/post-phase-4-status.md for the full group history.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pre-verification required at session start
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Confirm Group B.3 landed on main before starting:
  - Repo-wide grep: `grep -rn "fetch(sb.url()" api/ | grep -v "^api/_lib/supabase.js"`
    should return zero server-side results (only the client-side
    template-literal IIFE at api/generate-proposal.js:532 should match
    against a broader `SB+'/rest/v1/'` search).
  - docs/api-audit-2026-04.md should show L1 and L22 marked
    ✅ RESOLVED with Resolution blocks referencing the 22 Group B.3
    commits.

If either doesn't match expected state, pause and investigate.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scope — reconciliation pass
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Walk each open Low and Nit in order. For each one:

1. READ the finding in docs/api-audit-2026-04.md.
2. READ the code at the cited line number on current main.
3. CLASSIFY into one of three buckets:

   (a) Already fixed by a previous group. Mark ✅ RESOLVED with a
       Resolution block referencing the earlier commit that closed it
       and a one-line justification.

   (b) Small fix, ≤10 lines of code. Migrate, test via node --check
       and Vercel deploy status, mark ✅ RESOLVED.

   (c) Non-trivial or product-decision-gated. Leave open, add a
       "Current state (2026-04-18)" note under the finding so the
       next reader doesn't re-read the same code to re-diagnose.

Don't force (b) if the fix isn't actually small. The reconciliation
into (a) or the note into (c) is the primary value of this session;
code changes are a bonus.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Known reconciliation candidates (likely bucket (a))
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Some of these are likely already closed by earlier groups. Verify on
current main before deciding:

  - L3 (`var`-style declarations) — already on the "won't-fix-now"
    list. Mark as intentional and skip.
  - L13 (hardcoded asset URLs) — on the "won't-fix-now" list.
  - L15 (long-exp anon key) — on the "won't-fix-now" list; RLS is
    the control.
  - L17 (generate-proposal.js customPricing.amount_cents null check)
    — Group C commit `aabdac1` added `Number.isFinite` guards; verify.
  - L19 (enrich-proposal hardcoded personal-email domain blocklist)
    — likely still present but inconsequential; decide fix or note.
  - L20 (compile-report.js "14 inlined Supabase fetches") — should
    be fully closed by Group B.2 `0163f65`. Verify and mark ✅.
  - L23 (newsletter-generate stripEmDashes six-step replace chain)
    — cosmetic; decide.
  - L24 (send-audit-email.js wrong calendar URL?) — verify the URL
    against the canonical "moonraker-free-strategy-call" memory.
  - L28 (chat.js anthropic upstream error body pass-through) — known,
    tracked as "fold into future ops-batch session"; this is that
    session.

Bucket (b) candidates (≤10 lines):
  - N1 (sb.one returns null on error-shape) — likely a small fix in
    api/_lib/supabase.js.
  - N3 (monitor.js slug newline injection) — likely a small fix.

Remaining L/N entries: walk each, classify, reconcile, or note.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Deliverables
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Commit shape depends on what each reconciliation produces. Expect
several doc-only commits (bucket (a) and (c)) and maybe 2-5 code
commits (bucket (b)). Each code commit should be one file typically.

Doc updates at the end:
  - api-audit-2026-04.md: every L and N entry should either be
    ✅ RESOLVED with a Resolution block OR have a "Current state
    (2026-04-18)" note. Update running tallies accordingly.
  - post-phase-4-status.md: add Group I retrospective mirroring
    B.3's shape (what got reconciled to (a), what small code fixes
    landed for (b), what stays open with updated notes for (c)).
    Update "Where the audit stands" summary.

If the session reveals anything new (a latent bug, a pattern worth
extracting), file it with a fresh ID per the usual rule (continue
numbering; next Low is L29, next Nit is N7) and decide bucket (b) or
(c) for this session vs a future one.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Session theme check
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

If you find yourself wanting to refactor something substantial (> 30
lines, or introducing a new helper, or touching multiple files for
one finding), STOP — that's bucket (c) territory. Note it and move
on. The point of Group I is to close out the tail, not start a new
extraction project.
```

## Closing thought on the grouping approach

The original phase-based plan (phases 1-7) was right when the audit was fresh and we needed to prioritize Criticals. Now that Criticals are all closed, continuing phase-by-phase would force awkward sequencing — e.g. doing H9 in "Phase 5" and H18 in "Phase 7" even though they're unrelated.

Grouping by shape (what kind of fix, what files, what skill) means each session has a single theme, one mental model, one commit style. That's a better fit for the current phase of work.

# Client HQ API Security & Quality Audit

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Scope:** `api/*.js` (63 routes), `api/admin/*.js` (7 routes), `api/_lib/*.js` (8 shared modules). Excludes `api/cron/*` and the VPS agent service.

**Totals:** 9 Critical, 36 High, 38 Medium, 27 Low, 6 Nit.

Each finding has an ID (C/H/M/L/N-number) for reference in remediation commits and PRs.

---

## Executive summary

Four categories account for most findings:

1. **Functional bugs in critical flows.** Three routes are currently broken: `bootstrap-access.js` always 500s (C1/C8), `newsletter-webhook.js` updates random rows and then fails (C6), and `_lib/crypto.js` silently writes plaintext passwords when the encryption key is missing (C5). These are features that do not work today.

2. **Signature verification is wrong in both webhook routes.** Stripe (C2) and Resend/svix (H11) both reconstruct raw body via `JSON.stringify(req.body)` which does not reliably match signed bytes, and both use non-timing-safe string comparison. Both need `config.api.bodyParser = false` and `crypto.timingSafeEqual`.

3. **Public-to-production chains accept untrusted input without defense-in-depth.** Anyone can tamper with any onboarding client's data via `/api/onboarding-action` (C3/C7). Anyone can submit an endorsement that flows through Claude into deployed production HTML (C9). An admin JWT compromise via `action.js` filter injection (C4) gives read/write/delete access to 40+ tables with no audit log.

4. **Systemic code-quality debt.** `getDelegatedToken` is duplicated seven times across the codebase. ~30 routes bypass `_lib/supabase.js` and `_lib/github.js` with inline fetches. Hardcoded secret fallbacks live in source. No rate limiting anywhere. Errors leak internal detail to response bodies in ~20 places. `fetch()` without `AbortController` is the norm, not the exception.

Recommended remediation order in [Remediation plan](#remediation-plan) at the bottom.

## Critical

### C1. `api/bootstrap-access.js:25` — endpoint always throws ReferenceError
Handler calls `auth.requireAdmin(req, res)` at line 25, but `auth` is never required at module scope. The only `require('./_lib/auth')` in the file is on line 485, inside `getDelegatedToken()` — unreachable from the handler. Every invocation throws `ReferenceError: auth is not defined`, caught by outer try/catch, returns 500.

**Impact:** Post-Leadsie access-setup automation (GBP/GA4/GTM/LocalFalcon user grants) is 100% non-functional.

**Fix:** Move `var auth = require('./_lib/auth');` to line 20 alongside `sb`. Delete duplicate require on line 485.

### C2. `api/stripe-webhook.js` — signature verification unreliable
Three compounding issues:
1. No `config = { api: { bodyParser: false } }` export. Vercel parses JSON before handler sees it. Lines 28-34 reconstruct raw bytes via `JSON.stringify(req.body)`, which doesn't preserve key order, whitespace, or numeric formatting from what Stripe signed.
2. Line 60: `if (expected !== signature)` — plain string comparison, not timing-safe.
3. Line 42: `parts[kv[0].trim()] = kv[1]` — only the first `=` delimits, value isn't trimmed.

**Impact:** Probably works by accident on small/simple events. Any unusual event shape breaks silently — payment-to-onboarding transition won't fire. Timing side-channel for signature forgery.

**Fix:** Add `module.exports.config = { api: { bodyParser: false } };`. Read raw body via stream helper. Use `crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected, 'hex'), Buffer.from(signature, 'hex'))`. Parse `event` from the raw buffer, not from `req.body`.

### C3. `api/onboarding-action.js` — unauthenticated, cross-client data tampering
Route has no JWT check. Sole access control: "contact_id points to a contact with status='onboarding'". The contact_id comes from attacker-controlled request body.

1. `create_record` path: attacker passes `data: { contact_id: <any onboarding contact_id>, ... }`. Check on line 36 queries that contact, passes, then writes arbitrary rows to `bio_materials`, `practice_details`, `social_platforms`, `directory_listings`.
2. `update_record`/`delete_record`: `buildFilter(filters)` includes every filter key. Attacker passes `filters: { contact_id: victim, id: anything, status: 'neq.deleted' }` — compound filter hits all matching rows.
3. Same PostgREST filter injection as C4 (lines 81-93): values starting with `eq|neq|gt|...` prefix get passed through raw. `filters: { id: "in.(id1,id2,id3)" }` broadens scope. `DELETE` with filter injection could wipe large swaths.

**Confirmed exploit path:** `_templates/onboarding.html:1989` fetches `contacts?slug=eq.<CLIENT_SLUG>&select=*` using the public anon key, exposing `contact.id` in the browser. Slug is in the URL. Anyone visiting any onboarding client's page gets that client's UUID, then POSTs to `/api/onboarding-action`.

**Fix:** HMAC-signed token bound to `contact_id`, issued when onboarding URL is generated. Validate server-side; extract `contact_id` from verified token only. Harden `buildFilter` — see C4.

### C4. `api/action.js:82-94` — PostgREST filter value injection
Line 85 validates the *key*, but lines 87-88:
```js
if (typeof val === 'string' && /^(eq|neq|gt|gte|lt|lte|is|in)\./i.test(val)) {
  parts.push(key + '=' + val);
```
Any value starting with an allowed operator gets concatenated raw. An authenticated admin can pass `filters: { id: "in.(1,2,3,4)" }`, `"is.null"`, `"not.is.null"` — circumventing UI intent.

No audit log of who does what. `signed_agreements`, `payments`, `workspace_credentials` mutable without record.

**Impact:** Compromised admin JWT → full read/write/delete over 40+ tables, no forensic trail.

**Fix:** Structured filter shape `{ column, op, value }` with operator allowlist and `encodeURIComponent` on every value. For `in`, accept array and build `in.(...)` server-side. Write `activity_log` row on every mutation.

### C5. `api/_lib/crypto.js:29` — silent plaintext passthrough
```js
if (!key) return plaintext; // Passthrough if no key configured
```
If `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is unset (typo, rotation gap, config error), Gmail passwords, app passwords, authenticator secrets, and QR images get written in plaintext. No warning, no log.

**Impact:** Silent partial failure. Existing rows stay plaintext even after key is restored, until re-saved.

**Fix:** Throw in `getKey()` when env var missing. Loud warning at module load. Banner in admin UI when row ciphertext isn't `v1:`-prefixed.

### C6. `api/newsletter-webhook.js:51, 99, 104, 109, 127, 132` — entire webhook non-functional
Wrong calling convention throughout:
- `sb.query(path, opts)` expects `'newsletter_sends?resend_message_id=eq.X&select=...'` as single string. File calls `sb.query('newsletter_sends', 'resend_message_id=eq....')` — fetches with no filter, returns first 1000 rows, `sends[0]` is random.
- `sb.mutate(path, method, body, prefer)` — file calls `sb.mutate('newsletter_sends', 'id=eq.' + send.id, 'PATCH', updates)` — `method = 'id=eq.<uuid>'` (invalid HTTP verb).

**Impact:** All newsletter engagement tracking broken. Opens, clicks, bounces, complaints recorded by Resend never flow to `newsletter_sends`/`newsletter_subscribers`. Stats counters stay at zero.

**Fix:** Rewrite every call:
- `sb.query('newsletter_sends?resend_message_id=eq.' + encodeURIComponent(messageId) + '&select=...')`
- `sb.mutate('newsletter_sends?id=eq.' + send.id, 'PATCH', updates)`

Also address H11 signature issues in same PR.

### C7. `api/onboarding-action.js` — exploit path confirmed
Same root cause as C3. Filed separately to track the exploit-chain confirmation: `_templates/onboarding.html` exposes `contact.id` client-side via anon-key fetch, making C3 trivially exploitable by anyone who knows any onboarding client's slug.

### C8. `api/bootstrap-access.js:484-485` — mis-scoped require root cause
The definition site of the C1 bug. Lines 484-485:
```js
var crypto = require('crypto');
var auth = require('./_lib/auth');
```
`auth` is required inside `getDelegatedToken` where it's dead code, never referenced in that function body. The `crypto` require is used; `auth` was probably pasted next to it by mistake. Single-line fix: move to module scope.

### C9. `api/generate-content-page.js:410` + `_templates/endorsements.html:436` — public → Claude → production HTML injection chain
Endorsement collection page at `/<slug>/endorsements/` POSTs directly to Supabase with anon key. No auth, no captcha, no rate limit. RLS permits anon INSERT. Writes arbitrary `content`, `endorser_name`, `endorser_title` to `endorsements`.

Then in `generate-content-page.js`:
- Line 61: loads processed endorsements into prompt builder.
- Line 410: `msg += '  Quote: "' + e.content + '"\n';` — endorsement content interpolated verbatim into Claude's user prompt.
- Line 132-138: Claude Opus 4.6 generates complete HTML bio page with endorsements in an "Endorsement section" with `id="endorsement-section"`.
- Generated HTML saved to `content_pages.generated_html`, eventually deployed via `api/admin/deploy-to-r2.js` to client's production domain.

**Attack chain:**
1. Attacker submits endorsement with prompt injection in `content`.
2. Admin promotes endorsement to `status='processed'` (normal workflow, injection likely missed in long quote).
3. Content page generation runs.
4. Opus 4.6, though resistant, has non-zero compliance with injected instructions.
5. Generated HTML saved.
6. Admin deploys page (review is for content, not security).
7. Malicious JS executes on visitors to client's production bio page.

**Fix:** Defense in depth:
- Rate limit + captcha on collection form.
- Admin review flow with "user-submitted, may contain prompt injection" banner.
- Structured delimiters in prompt (pass endorsements as JSON array, tell Claude it's data to quote, not instructions).
- Server-side HTML sanitization before persisting/deploying (strip `<script>` not on allowlist).

## High

### H1. `api/_lib/auth.js:160` — `_profileCache` has no TTL ✅ RESOLVED
Module-scoped cache persists across warm invocations (up to 15min). Removing an admin from `admin_profiles` has no effect until cold start. Add 60s TTL or drop the cache.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `6e8a51a`, Group G batch 1):** `_profileCache` entries now store `{ profile, fetched_at }` with a 60s TTL (`PROFILE_CACHE_TTL_MS = 60000`). `getAdminProfile` checks `Date.now() - cached.fetched_at < PROFILE_CACHE_TTL_MS`; on miss or expiry, it re-queries `admin_profiles` and refreshes the cache entry. A deleted admin now loses access within 60s instead of persisting until the Vercel instance cold-starts. SELECT extended to include `last_login_at` so the M2 throttle (same commit) can read from cache without an extra DB round-trip. Bundled with M2 because both changes touch `_profileCache` and need to land atomically.

### H2. Same filter-injection bug in `api/onboarding-action.js:81-93` (public) and `api/action.js:82-94` (admin) ✅ RESOLVED
Same `buildFilter` helper duplicated in both files. Fix together via shared `_lib/postgrest-filter.js`.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `e00be4c`, Phase 4 S5, doc-marked in Group G batch 1):** Closed incidentally by the C4 remediation work. `api/_lib/postgrest-filter.js` was extracted with an operator allowlist and per-value `encodeURIComponent`, then wired into both `api/action.js` (three call sites at L60, L96, L132 via `pgFilter.buildFilter(filters)`) and `api/onboarding-action.js` (two call sites at L95, L105). Both files' inline `buildFilter` declarations were deleted. The dedup plus the hardening landed in the same commit — no remaining duplication and no remaining injection surface. Verified on current `main` during the Group G batch 1 walkthrough: the helper module exists, both handlers require it, and neither file defines a local `buildFilter`.

### H3. `api/_lib/auth.js:143-145` — `rawToDer()` dead code with misleading comment ✅ RESOLVED
Function returns input unchanged; `derSig` assignment is ignored. Comment claims ES256 needs DER, but `dsaEncoding: 'ieee-p1363'` handles it natively. Delete.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `f1c0d22`, Group G batch 1):** Deleted the `var derSig = rawToDer(signature);` assignment and its two-line misleading comment block at the call site, plus the `function rawToDer(raw) { return raw; }` declaration and its comment block below `verifyJwt`. Both `nodeCrypto.verify` calls at the original L111 and L123 were already passing the unconverted `signature` buffer — the dead variable never reached them. No behavioral change. Grep-verified no `rawToDer`/`derSig` references remain in the file after the edit.

### H4. `api/_lib/supabase.js` — no fetch timeout/retry ✅ RESOLVED
`query()` and `mutate()` have no `AbortController`. PostgREST hang burns full function budget. Wrap in AbortController with 10s default + 1 retry with exponential backoff for 5xx.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commits `12c805f` + `f2a1b70`, Group B.2):** New helper `api/_lib/fetch-with-timeout.js` (`12c805f`) wraps the global `fetch()` with an `AbortController`-backed timeout. Signature matches the original closure in `compile-report.js` (`url, opts, timeoutMs`) with a 25s default and stable `Timeout after Xms:` error prefix (now includes the URL for debuggability). `supabase.js` migrated in `f2a1b70`: both `query()` and `mutate()` now call the helper with a 10s default for PostgREST calls — if the DB is degraded we fail fast rather than burning the full Vercel function budget. Both functions accept an optional timeout override: `query(path, { timeoutMs })` piggybacks on the existing `opts` object, and `mutate(path, method, body, prefer, timeoutMs)` takes an optional 5th arg so all existing 4-arg callers keep working unchanged. Retry-on-5xx intentionally not added here — it's tracked separately under Group G (operational resilience). **`fetchWithTimeout` is now the canonical HTTP client for all non-streaming routes; future work should use it by default.**

### H5. AI chat endpoints — no rate limiting ✅ RESOLVED
`agreement-chat.js`, `content-chat.js`, `proposal-chat.js`, `report-chat.js` have zero auth and stream Claude. CORS header is browser enforcement; `curl` ignores it. Direct bill-amplification attack surface. Add IP-based rate limit + server-side Origin check that rejects empty Origin.

### H6. `api/stripe-webhook.js:129-148` — fire-and-forget HTTP calls ✅ RESOLVED
Cross-function POSTs to `/api/notify-team` and `/api/setup-audit-schedule` with no retry. Convert to queue table + cron processor, or inline as importable modules.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `b3d5d8b`, Group G batch 2):** Inline-await + monitor.critical approach (option b from the session prompt; Stripe webhook volume is low, queue-table durability wasn't warranted). Both fire-and-forget `.catch()` POSTs at L161-182 of current main converted to awaited `fetchT(..., 15000)` calls wrapped in independent try/catch blocks. Each stage fires `monitor.critical('stripe-webhook', err, { client_slug: slug, detail: { stage: 'notify_team' | 'setup_audit_schedule', session_id, ... } })` on throw OR on non-2xx response — so both transport failures (timeout, DNS, connection reset) and handler-side failures (500 from notify-team, auth rejection) surface via the email alert to chris@moonraker.ai plus an error_log row with body_preview. `results.notify_team_failed` / `results.setup_audit_schedule_failed` booleans annotate the response body for any operator watching stripe webhook responses directly. `res.status(200)` preserved at the end — Stripe must not retry the webhook because the status flip + payments insert are already done and idempotent-but-noisy if re-run. The inner try/catch around `monitor.critical` itself is belt-and-suspenders: even if Resend is down and the critical email can't send, we don't mask the 200 back to Stripe. `fetchT` added to the top-of-file require list alongside the existing crypto / sb / monitor imports. Scope note: the `payments` INSERT at L191 still uses `console.log` on error — not in H6 scope (H6 is specifically the two cross-function POSTs), filed as candidate follow-up.

### H7. `api/_lib/supabase.js:15` — hardcoded fallback URL ✅ RESOLVED
```js
SUPABASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || 'https://ofmmwcjhdrhvxxkhcuww.supabase.co';
```
Throw if env var unset instead of falling back.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `330e6da`):** Fallback string removed. `url()` now throws `'NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL not configured'` on first call if env var is unset. Module-load `console.error` surfaces the gap in Vercel logs before the first route hits `url()`. Mirrors the H9/H10/C5 pattern. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` verified set across production/preview/development prior to removing the fallback.

### H8. `api/_lib/crypto.js:45` — decrypt returns literal error strings as values ✅ RESOLVED
`'[encrypted - key not available]'` and `'[decryption failed]'` flow back to callers as if they were plaintext. Read-then-write cycle would encrypt the error strings. Throw instead.

### H9. `api/admin/deploy-to-r2.js:10` — hardcoded secret fallback in source ✅ RESOLVED
```js
var DEPLOY_SECRET = process.env.CF_R2_DEPLOY_SECRET || 'moonraker-r2-deploy-2026';
```
Live secret in git history (confirmed via `git log -p`). Assume compromised. Rotate, remove fallback, throw at module load.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `36ac5bb`):** Rotated `CF_R2_DEPLOY_SECRET` in Vercel to a fresh 32-byte hex value. Uploaded transitional Worker accepting both old and new, then final Worker (`env.DEPLOY_SECRET` only) after verification. Removed source fallback; handler now returns 500 `'Deploy secret not configured'` if env missing, module-load `console.error` warning mirrors the C5 pattern. **Discovered during rotation:** the literal `'moonraker-r2-deploy-2026'` in source had been dead code in production — the Worker's own source had a different hardcoded value (`fa8e68f5…`), so the git-history string would never have authenticated against the live Worker. The actual live secret was in the Worker's uploaded script (not a secret binding) and is now rotated and moved to a proper secret binding.

### H10. `api/admin/manage-site.js:15, 18` — hardcoded CF account/zone IDs ✅ RESOLVED
Not secrets but infrastructure identifiers. Move to env.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `e772fa9`):** Removed literal `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` fallback; migrated `MOONRAKER_ZONE_ID` from source literal to new `CF_ZONE_ID` env var on Vercel. Added module-load warnings for all three required CF env vars (`CF_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CF_API_TOKEN`, `CF_ZONE_ID`) and request-time 500 if any are missing (except `action: 'status'` which is DB-read-only). Matches the C5 fail-closed pattern.

### H11. `api/newsletter-webhook.js:27, 32, 35-37` — same signature issues as Stripe ✅ RESOLVED
- Line 27: `JSON.stringify(req.body)` raw-body reconstruction won't match svix's signed bytes.
- Line 32: `signatures.indexOf(expected) === -1` not timing-safe.
- Line 35-37: Fail-open if `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` unset.

Fix alongside C6.

### H12. `api/content-chat.js` — public, uses Opus 4.6, filter injection ✅ RESOLVED
- Line 28: empty-Origin bypass.
- Line 47-50: `content_page_id` from request body, no UUID validation.
- Line 114: raw concatenation into PostgREST URL.
- No ownership check — anyone with a content_page_id UUID can stream Claude content about that client.
- Claude Opus 4.6 with 4000 max_tokens — most expensive endpoint.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commits `502f6213` + `34fca146`, Group F):** All five sub-issues closed. **Empty-Origin bypass (`502f6213`):** flipped `if (origin && ...)` to `if (!origin || origin !== 'https://clients.moonraker.ai')` — same commit as H15's submit-entity-audit.js fix (shared pattern). **UUID validation + filter safety (`34fca146`):** added the canonical UUID regex check immediately after body parsing; returns 400 on non-UUID. `encodeURIComponent()` applied defense-in-depth at the three PostgREST concat sites inside `fetchPageContext` (content_pages, contacts, design_specs, practice_details). **Ownership (`34fca146`):** status-based gate per session prompt's option (c) — `fetchPageContext` now reads `contact.lost` and `contact.status` and returns `null` when the contact is lost; handler 404s. Page-token option (a) deferred: `content_preview` scope exists in `_lib/page-token.js` SCOPES, but deployed content-preview templates don't demonstrably inject `__PAGE_TOKEN__`, so switching to required-token verification would break production chatbots. Status-based gate is the interim. Opus 4.6 model choice + 4000 max_tokens unchanged — rate limit (20/min/IP from Phase 4 S4) is the cost control, and sub-issue (e) was always categorized as a note, not a fix.

### H13. `api/agreement-chat.js:119+` — full CSA (~8K tokens) in every system prompt ✅ RESOLVED
Pays for full CSA every request. Use Anthropic prompt caching with breakpoint after CSA block.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `fba6183`, Group G batch 2):** `buildSystemPrompt(context)` now returns a 2-element array of system content blocks instead of a single string. Block 1 is the preamble + CRITICAL RULES + WHAT YOU KNOW + `PAGE CONTENT` section including the `${pageContent.substring(0, 8000)}` interpolation (varies per conversation). Block 2 is the static `===== CLIENT SERVICE AGREEMENT (FULL TEXT) =====` through the response guidelines (`- End responses on an encouraging, forward-moving note when natural`), with `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }` applied to the block. Call site changed from `system: systemPrompt` to `system: systemBlocks`. Concatenation of block1.text + block2.text is byte-identical to the original single-string prompt (split point is immediately after the interpolation, blank-line separator preserved on block 2's leading side) so model behavior is preserved. Expected effect: turn 2+ of the same conversation hits the Anthropic prompt cache for the full prefix (~8.5K tokens of preamble + CSA), dropping cached-prefix cost to ~10% of uncached tokens. Cross-conversation caching is partial (`pageContent` varies) — the larger win would require reordering the prompt to put the static CSA BEFORE pageContent, which is out of scope for operational resilience (would change prompt ordering and potentially model behavior). Filed as candidate follow-up. Scope fence respected: rate limit, origin check, Anthropic fetch retry+buffering, streaming pipe untouched. Smoke verification on first multi-turn agreement-chat session should confirm `usage.cache_read_input_tokens` is ~8K+ in the `message_start` event of turn 2+.

### H14. `api/submit-entity-audit.js:54-57` — global rate limit is DoS surface ✅ RESOLVED
Attacker sending 20 requests in an hour blocks all legitimate submissions. Per-IP bucketing + captcha.

### H15. `api/submit-entity-audit.js:17` — empty Origin bypasses check ✅ RESOLVED
Same pattern as chat endpoints. `curl` sends no Origin, passes.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `502f6213`, Group F):** Single commit across both affected files (shared pattern). `if (origin && origin !== 'https://clients.moonraker.ai')` flipped to `if (!origin || origin !== 'https://clients.moonraker.ai')` in `api/submit-entity-audit.js:L19` and `api/content-chat.js:L32`. Callers that strip the Origin header (curl, non-browser tooling) no longer bypass the check. Rate limit (3/hr/IP from Phase 4 S4 in submit-entity-audit.js, 20/min/IP in content-chat.js) remains the primary control against curl-style abuse; this closes the defense-in-depth gap called out in the finding. `+4/-2` each file; no behavioral change for any honest browser caller.

### H16. `api/process-entity-audit.js:443, 473, 522` — template deployed without placeholder substitution ✅ RESOLVED
`content: tmplData.content.replace(/\n/g, '')` pushes template verbatim. If template uses `{{SLUG}}` or `{{PRACTICE_NAME}}` placeholders expecting server-side substitution, deployed page shows literal placeholders. Verify pattern vs proposal template.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `2eb09dba`, H16+H23 mini-session):** Added a `prepTemplate(base64Content, replacements)` helper near the top of `process-entity-audit.js` (just after the `_lib` requires block). Matches the canonical pattern in `generate-proposal.js:560`: decode base64 → apply `{{KEY}}` replacements if supplied → re-encode to base64. All three deploy sites (L459 entity-audit.html, L489 entity-audit-checkout.html, L538 suite loop for diagnosis/action-plan/progress) now use `content: prepTemplate(<tmpl>.content)` in place of the old `.replace(/\n/g, '')` shape. Pre-check confirmed zero placeholders across all 5 templates today, so no behavioral change ships; the route is now ready for any future `{{SLUG}}`/`{{PRACTICE_NAME}}` substitution without another shape rewrite. `node --check` passed; Vercel deploy READY.

### H17. `api/process-entity-audit.js:570-575` — internal auth fallback pattern unsafe ✅ RESOLVED
`var internalAuth = process.env.CRON_SECRET || process.env.AGENT_API_KEY || '';` — falls back to empty string; downstream call to `send-audit-email` gets `Authorization: Bearer ` which fails closed. But the pattern of OR'ing server secrets is wrong shape — hard-require at module load.

Line 599 onwards embeds `contact.first_name`, `contact.last_name` in notification email HTML without escaping. Free-audit contacts come from `submit-entity-audit.js` (public). Malicious submitter → injected HTML in team notification emails.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `7f094dc`, Group G batch 1):** Both sub-issues closed in one commit.

**Sub 1 (auth):** The `CRON_SECRET || AGENT_API_KEY || ''` chain at L550 replaced with an explicit `process.env.AGENT_API_KEY` read and a `throw new Error('AGENT_API_KEY not configured — cannot call send-audit-email')` guard. The route is only invoked from the agent callback path (not a cron), so AGENT_API_KEY is the deliberate identity and CRON_SECRET was never semantically correct for this call. The throw lands inside the existing try/catch, which emits `step: 'auto_send_warning'` with the error text so the manual-send fallback kicks in. Env regression now produces a visible per-audit warning instead of a silent 401 at send-audit-email.

**Sub 2 (HTML injection):** Added `var sanitizer = require('./_lib/html-sanitizer')` at the top of the file alongside the other `_lib` imports. Both notification email bodies (premium-review at L579-585 and quarterly at L623-628) now wrap every interpolated variable in `sanitizer.sanitizeText()` at reasonable length caps: `contact.first_name`/`contact.last_name` 100, `practiceName` 200, `audit.audit_period` 50, `cresScore` 20 (via `String(cresScore)`). `auditId` uses `encodeURIComponent` inside the `<a href="...audit-...">` URLs because `sanitizeText` would strip the hyphens a UUID needs. `varianceHtml` left raw because it's built from server-computed numeric scores and percentage deltas via `fmtDelta()` — no user-controlled surface. Subject lines also sanitized since Resend renders them in the team inbox's HTML preview. Scope fence held: the file has other HTML-emitting sites (scorecard page template read/substitute/push around L419-538) but those are out of H17's stated scope — any additional interpolation-safety findings there should file separately per the session prompt.

### H18. `_lib/newsletter-template.js:53, 55, 58, 66, 68, 218-231` — untrusted content rendered unescaped ✅ RESOLVED
Story `body`, `headline`, action items, quick wins, `finalThoughts` all inserted raw. If AI generation glitch produces malformed HTML, breaks every subscriber's layout. Compromised admin JWT could inject HTML into emails to all subscribers.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `0cd0670`):** `esc()` applied at the seven plain-text interpolation sites flagged — `story.headline`, action list items (both string-split and array paths), `spotlight.headline`, `spotlight.cta_text`, quick-wins items. Also extended to the `buildBlog()` path (action items and any future untrusted fields). **Scope fence held:** `story.body`, `spotlight.body`, and `finalThoughts` remain raw because AI generation explicitly produces HTML `<p>` tags and inline formatting for those fields; indiscriminate escaping would break every subscriber's email. Design note for future work: if we ever want AI to emit markdown instead of HTML, that's a prompt-engineering change, not a template change.

### H19. `_lib/newsletter-template.js:41, 220` — `image_url` only `esc()`-ed, no scheme validation ✅ RESOLVED
`javascript:` or `data:` schemes escape HTML but remain clickable in some email clients. Validate `https://` prefix at write time + render time.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `0cd0670`):** Added `validateImageUrl(url)` helper in `_lib/newsletter-template.js` that returns the URL only if it starts with `https://` or `http://` (case-insensitive regex `/^https?:\/\//i`), else returns `''` (safe fallback — no image rendered). Applied at both `storyBlock()` and `buildBlog()` image rendering sites. Exported from module for any future callers that need to validate external URLs before rendering.

### H20. `_lib/email-template.js:48-50, 164` — `p()` and `footerNote` insert raw HTML ✅ RESOLVED
Helper signature invites misuse. Every caller must remember to escape. Rename to `pRaw`, add safe `p()` that escapes by default.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `d024b84`):** Atomic 9-file rename commit. In `_lib/email-template.js`: renamed original `p()` → `pRaw()`; new `p()` escape-by-default now exists; both exported. `wrap()` now supports `options.footerNote` (new, escapes input) alongside `options.footerNoteRaw` (current raw behavior), with `footerNoteRaw` winning if both are set. All 82+ `email.p(` call sites across 8 caller files (compile-report, generate-audit-followups, generate-followups, ingest-batch-audit, ingest-surge-content, notify-team, send-audit-email, send-proposal-email) migrated to `email.pRaw(` mechanically — byte-identical email output preserved. One caller (`send-proposal-email.js`) passed an `<a>` tag through `footerNote`; migrated to `footerNoteRaw`. Remaining `footerNote:` callers pass plain text only (grep-verified). Future sessions can opportunistically upgrade plain-text `pRaw` call sites to the new safe `p()` — flagged as follow-up, not blocking.

### H21. Seven copies of `getDelegatedToken`/`getGoogleAccessToken` ✅ RESOLVED
- `api/bootstrap-access.js:480`
- `api/compile-report.js:909` (no impersonation variant: `getGoogleAccessToken`)
- `api/compile-report.js:1012`
- `api/generate-proposal.js:678`
- `api/enrich-proposal.js:414`
- `api/discover-services.js:281`
- `api/_lib/google-drive.js:39-59` (the only copy that caches tokens)

Extract once to `_lib/google-auth.js` with token caching keyed on `(scope, impersonate)`. Replace all sites.

**Partial progress (2026-04-17, commit `7adedb6`):** Helper module `api/_lib/google-delegated.js` created with `getDelegatedAccessToken(mailbox, scope)`, `getServiceAccountToken(scope)`, `getFirstWorkingImpersonation(mailboxes, scope, testFn)`, and `_tokenCache` keyed on `${mailbox||'sa'}|${scope}`. First and only caller so far is the new `api/campaign-summary.js` feature (not part of audit scope). **The 5 existing duplicate sites listed above still hold their own copies** — migration is the remaining H21 work.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, Group B.1):** All 5 duplicate sites migrated to the helper.
- `bootstrap-access.js` → commit `17d0ae8` (GBP/GA4/GTM delegated tokens).
- `discover-services.js` → commit `4e77e55` (now calls `google.getServiceAccountToken`, non-delegated variant).
- `enrich-proposal.js` → commit `568a868`. Gmail for-loop at L98: nested try/catch around `google.getDelegatedAccessToken(acct, gmailScope)`; on inner throw `continue` jumps to next mailbox without tripping the outer catch that would push a `{account, error}` row — preserves the original silent-skip semantics of the old `typeof token === 'string'` guard. Guard itself replaced with a plain `{ }` block so happy-path indentation didn't shift.
- `generate-proposal.js` → commit `d592381`. Single Drive-folder call at L653 wrapped in nested try/catch; `results.drive.error = 'Failed to get Drive token: ' + (tokenErr.message || String(tokenErr))` on failure, happy path gated on `if (driveToken)`.
- `compile-report.js` → commit `1d9c835`. Both `safe()`-wrapped closures (GSC L181, GBP L256) migrated to the same try/catch pattern; original warning prefixes preserved (`'GSC: token failed - '` and `'GBP Performance: delegated token failed - '`). Also deleted dead `getGoogleAccessToken` (no callers — see L16).

Final grep across `api/` on main: **one remaining copy discovered in `convert-to-prospect.js` after Group B.1 closed** — see **H36** below. This is an 8th duplicate that wasn't in the original audit's H21 list. The 5 sites Group B.1 was scoped to (bootstrap-access, compile-report ×2, discover-services, enrich-proposal, generate-proposal) are all migrated correctly. H21 as scoped is resolved; H36 tracks the newly-discovered 8th site.

`_lib/google-drive.js` is still tracked separately (N6) and is out of Group B.1 scope.

### H22. `api/generate-proposal.js:361` — AI-generated `next_steps` rendered into deployed HTML unescaped ✅ RESOLVED
If `enrichment_data` (admin-written, unsanitized) contains prompt injection convincing Claude to emit `<script>`, ends up in prospect-facing deployed proposal. Also line 330: `customPricing.amount_cents / 100` admin-controlled, no type validation, flows into checkout card HTML.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `aabdac1`):** Added local `esc()` helper (same shape as email/newsletter-template versions; not imported to keep `generate-proposal.js` dependency-minimal — it deploys HTML, not email). `amount_cents` now coerced via `Number()` then validated with `Number.isFinite(amt) && amt >= 0` — invalid values render `—` instead of literal `$NaN` in the deployed proposal. `customPricing.label || customPricing.period` and both `next_steps` fields (`s.title`, `s.desc || s.description`) escaped at render time.

### H23. `api/chat.js:184, 190` — entire admin DB dumped into system prompt every turn ✅ RESOLVED
`clientData` + `clientIndex` serialized as JSON in system prompt. Every admin chat turn re-sends 10K+ tokens. Client PII (emails, phones, practice names) flows to Anthropic on every turn. Use prompt caching, or reduce to just the client being discussed.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, H16+H23 mini-session):** Both remediations applied in two atomic commits.

**Part 1 — scope reduction (commit `484dc8e5`):** In `buildSystemPrompt`, the `clientIndex` read is now gated on `clientSlug`: `var clientIndex = clientSlug ? null : (ctx.clientIndex || null);`. Deep-dive pages (where `clientSlug` is set and `clientData` is loaded) no longer ship the ~60-client roster, saving ~5K tokens on every turn. Dashboard and list pages keep the index unchanged. Single-line value change in the existing dynamic-block assembly; no call-site changes.

**Part 2 — prompt caching (commit `052f2245`):** `buildSystemPrompt` now returns a 2-block `system:` array with an Anthropic prompt-caching breakpoint on the first (static) block. Static prefix = `BASE_PROMPT` + mode selector (`DIRECT_ANSWER_MODE` when deep-dive-with-data, `CROSS_CLIENT_OPS` otherwise) + `BASE_PROMPT_STYLE` + `MODE_*` (audits/deliverables/onboarding/reports/clients/dashboard based on page). Dynamic tail = `## Current Context` + `clientData` JSON (if present) + `clientIndex` JSON (if not scope-dropped). Call site at L36/L61 renamed `systemPrompt → systemBlocks`; stream POST body now passes `system: systemBlocks`. Mirrors the H13 shape in `agreement-chat.js:100`. Expected on turn 2+ of a chat session on the same page: `usage.cache_read_input_tokens` ~= static prefix token count (billed at 10%), `cache_creation_input_tokens = 0`; only the dynamic tail is billed at full rate.

**Combined savings on a typical admin deep-dive chat session:** turn 1 pays static+dynamic; turns 2+ pay 10% × static + full × dynamic. With `clientIndex` dropped on deep-dive, per-turn uncached tokens fall from ~15K (static+clientData+clientIndex) to roughly the clientData blob alone. Vercel deploys READY for both commits.

### H24. `api/compile-report.js` — 23 unbounded fetches despite having `fetchT` helper ✅ RESOLVED
File defines `fetchT(url, opts, timeoutMs)` on line 87 and uses it 8 times (GSC, LocalFalcon). 23 other calls still use bare `fetch()`. Supabase queries, Claude call in retry loop, Resend sends — all can hang.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `0163f65`, Group B.2):** Closure-scope `fetchT` deleted; file now imports the shared `_lib/fetch-with-timeout` helper. All 21 `fetch()` sites addressed: 16 Supabase direct-REST calls migrated to `sb.query`/`sb.one`/`sb.mutate` (includes the previously closure-wrapped L571 checklist query, now using `sb.query` since the helper supports timeouts natively after H4); 3 external calls explicitly wrapped at tiered timeouts (Resend 15s at L828, GSC sites list 15s at L933, Claude 60s at L1032); the 7 pre-existing wrapped GSC/GBP/LocalFalcon call sites require no change at the invocation point — they now resolve to the module helper via the top-level `require`. Grep verification: `grep -cE '\\bfetch\\(' compile-report.js` → 0. **Behavior-preservation notes:** on the highlights DELETE+POST pair (L735 primary + L749 fallback), inner try/catches were added around each `sb.mutate` — `sb.mutate` throws on PostgREST 4xx/5xx while the previous raw `fetch` was silent-fail, so the wrap preserves the original "warn and continue" / silent-fail semantics and prevents accidental fallback-branch triggering on a failed DELETE. The non-transactional DELETE+INSERT pattern itself remains open (H27, Group E). On three Supabase sites that previously threw custom strings (`PATCH failed: …`, `INSERT failed: …`, `Status flip failed: …`), the user-facing 500 message shape stays the same (wrapping `e.message`) — only the interior detail text differs, now prefixed `Supabase mutate error:` from the shared helper.

### H25. `api/compile-report.js:1119` — `practiceName` raw-interpolated into Claude prompt ✅ RESOLVED
Prompt injection via admin-controlled `practice_name` affects report highlights. Combined with C4, admin-JWT → content-manipulation chain.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `e4d9105`, Group D):** Added `var sanitizer = require('./_lib/html-sanitizer');` alongside existing `_lib` requires at L21-25. Sanitized at source at L120 by wrapping the `contact.practice_name || (contact.first_name + ' ' + contact.last_name).trim()` expression in `sanitizer.sanitizeText(..., 200)`. This closes the flagged Claude prompt site (`generateHighlights()` at L1034) and incidentally hardens all 8 downstream email/report rendering sites noted in the audit (L730, L812, L830, L859, L1071, L1089, L1108, L1115) in one edit — since `sanitizeText` treats `&` as literal text (not entity), practice names like "Smith & Jones Therapy" render correctly through all downstream email HTML sites. `metricsContext` at L973 is system-sourced Supabase numerics; left alone per scope fence.

### H26. `api/generate-proposal.js:573-590` — onboarding seed is non-transactional DELETE+INSERT ✅ RESOLVED
Crash between DELETE and INSERT leaves contact with zero onboarding steps. `auto_promote_to_active` trigger never fires. Use PostgREST upsert or RPC.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `4fc3f69`, Group E):** DELETE+POST pair replaced with upsert on the existing `UNIQUE(contact_id, step_key)` index using `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates,return=minimal`. The contact status flip at the top of the block also migrated from bare `fetch` to `sb.mutate`. Added a targeted stale-row cleanup (`onboarding_steps?contact_id=eq.X&step_key=not.in.(...)`) so future template shrinkage doesn't leave orphaned steps — scoped by `contact_id` so it can never touch another contact's rows. Production pre-check showed zero stale rows at migration time, so the cleanup is a future-proof no-op today. Each of the three sub-steps (status flip, stale cleanup, upsert) is independently try/caught and surfaces failures in `results.conversion.{status_error, stale_cleanup_error, onboarding_error}` rather than silently short-circuiting. Re-running proposal generation is now idempotent and never leaves the checklist empty; the zero-row window that would block `auto_promote_to_active` is closed.

### H27. `api/compile-report.js:726, 740, 743` — same non-transactional pattern for highlights ✅ RESOLVED
DELETE old, INSERT new. Crash between = zero highlights. Fallback on line 738-746 compounds it.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `886fe05`, Group E):** Both the primary `generateHighlights()` path (~L700) and the `buildFallbackHighlights()` path (~L713) replaced with upsert via `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates,return=minimal`. Backed by new migration `report_highlights_unique_slug_month_sort` which adds `UNIQUE(client_slug, report_month, sort_order)` — pre-verified zero duplicates across the existing 87 rows before creating the unique index. Both helpers already return rows shaped with that exact triple, so no upstream changes were needed. The B.2 try/catch warning wrappers are preserved; they now wrap a single upsert call instead of a DELETE+POST sequence, so the error surface is cleaner and the two-step window is eliminated.

### H28. `api/bootstrap-access.js:466-473` — response body returns `results` with provider error detail ✅ RESOLVED
`results.{gbp,ga4,gtm,localfalcon}.error` can contain JSON excerpts from Google/LocalFalcon APIs including account IDs, quotas, internal messages. Admin-only but any log capture exposes raw provider error bodies.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `0c9bc85`):** Added `var monitor = require('./_lib/monitor');`. Every catch site (`load_contact`, `load_report_config`, GBP/GA4/GTM/LocalFalcon providers, `config_save`, `deliverable_update`) now calls `monitor.logError('bootstrap-access', e, { client_slug, detail: { provider, ... } })` with raw debug (token errors, GBP Approach A/B strings, LF add response) routed to `error_log` server-side. Response body now uses a new `publicResults` object (built via `pickDefined()` filter) that drops internal resource identifiers — `gbp.account`, `gbp.location_name`, `ga4.property`, `gtm.account` — and keeps only admin-UI-consumed fields (`location_title`, `gbp_location_id`, `display_name`, `container_name`, `container_id`, `place_id`, `users_added`). Thrown error messages in provider blocks replaced with generic strings (`'Google authentication failed'`, `'No matching GBP location found (check Leadsie access)'`, `'LocalFalcon add location failed'`, etc.) so `reason = e.message` can no longer carry PII. `errors` array entries follow the same generic pattern.

### H29. `api/enrich-proposal.js` — searches three team inboxes via domain-wide delegation
Lines 92-148. Impersonates `chris@`, `scott@`, `support@` to run Gmail searches. Results stored in `proposals.enrichment_data` as plaintext JSONB. Admin JWT compromise → Gmail search oracle over team inboxes. `searchDomain` is admin-controlled (via `website_url`) — creating a contact with `website_url = 'moonraker.ai'` returns internal business communications.

Also affects C4 blast radius: `enrichment_data` is readable via `action.js`, unencrypted. Encrypt at rest via `_lib/crypto.js`.

**Status (2026-04-18, Group G batch 2):** 🔶 DEFERRED — BLOCKED ON DESIGN. Infra-check performed against current `_lib/crypto.js` surfaced four unresolved design decisions that exceed the 30-minute budget carved out for H29:
1. **JSONB shape.** `crypto.encryptFields` only operates on string values (L86 `typeof === 'string'` gate) and `encrypt()` rejects non-strings. `enrichment_data` is a JSONB object with nested `emails[]`, `calls[]`, `audit_scores`, `audit_tasks`, `website_info`, `practice_details`. Three options: extend `encryptFields` to `JSON.stringify` JSONB fields before encrypt and `JSON.parse` after decrypt (simplest, one helper change), split `enrichment_data` into encrypted scalar columns (invasive schema change), or encrypt at the call site in `enrich-proposal.js` with a dedicated wrapper.
2. **Read-path surface.** `enrichment_data` is read by `enrich-proposal.js` (self, post-write), `generate-proposal.js` (downstream consumer for Claude prompt context), and is reachable via `action.js` admin reads (the C4-blast-radius concern the finding calls out). Any encrypt-at-rest choice requires corresponding decrypt wiring at all readers; action.js's per-table SENSITIVE_FIELDS convention is currently scoped to `workspace_credentials` (`gmail_password`, `app_password`, `authenticator_secret_key`, `qr_code_image`) and extending it per-table is a shape change to the action.js module, not a one-field addition.
3. **Legacy-row migration.** Existing `proposals` rows hold plaintext JSONB. `crypto.decrypt` passthrough on non-`v1:`-prefixed strings works for strings but not for object-typed legacy values that never round-tripped through `JSON.stringify`. A one-time backfill (encrypt-in-place) or a read-path dual-shape handler is needed; neither is trivial.
4. **`enrichment_sources` sibling + rotation.** The same PATCH at `enrich-proposal.js:L391-397` writes both `enrichment_sources` (Gmail message IDs, Fathom recording IDs, search queries) and `enrichment_data`. Both are sensitive; consistency argues for encrypting both. Key-rotation story exists for `workspace_credentials` (admin UI re-saves on rotation) but not for a field that accumulates per-proposal forever — a bulk re-encrypt migration would be needed for rotation.

**Recommendation:** Split H29 into a dedicated design session that picks between options (1)/(2)/(3), then a scoped code session that lands the chosen wiring plus a backfill migration for existing rows. Until then, the admin-JWT-gated read surface, Group B.1's token caching (which at least stops repeated gmail impersonation mints), and the rate-limit on enrich-proposal remain the interim controls.

### H30. `api/enrich-proposal.js:161` — Fathom dedup uses string match ✅ RESOLVED
Works but is the sixth copy of `getDelegatedToken` (line 414) with no caching. Multiple Fathom + Gmail calls each mint fresh JWTs. Wasteful but not broken.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `568a868`, Group B.1):** Subsumed by the H21 migration. Gmail for-loop now calls `google.getDelegatedAccessToken(acct, gmailScope)`, which caches tokens in `_tokenCache` keyed on `${mailbox}|${scope}` with a 60s expiry guard (see `_lib/google-delegated.js`). Three-mailbox sweep inside the same request now mints one JWT per mailbox/scope pair instead of three fresh JWTs per call. Local `getDelegatedToken` deleted.

### H31. `api/generate-content-page.js:419` — 25K chars of RTPBA passed to Claude verbatim ✅ RESOLVED
RTPBA originates from Surge agent output parsed from client's website. Narrower surface than C9 — requires attacker to control client site content. Line 81-88 also extracts RTPBA from `entity_audits.surge_data.raw_text` via substring starting at literal "Ready-to-Publish" — 5000 chars from any injection point.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `54153ec`, Group D):** `sanitizer` already imported at L9. In `buildUserMessage` (L336-480), wrapped 12 contact/practice/bio/endorsement interpolation sites with `sanitizer.sanitizeText(value, maxLen)`: Practice Info (`practice_name` 200, `first_name`/`last_name`/`credentials` 100 each), Practice Details (`ideal_client`/`differentiators`/`intake_process` 1000 each), Bio loop (`therapist_name` 100, `therapist_credentials` 200, `professional_bio`/`clinical_approach` 2000 each), Endorsement loop (`endorser_name`/`endorser_title`/`endorser_org`/`relationship` 100 each, `content` 2000 — double-sanitization, belt-and-suspenders over C9). The three large untrusted blobs now use bracketed delimiter framing: `rtpba` (25000 maxLen), Surge `intelligence` (3000), Surge `action_plan` (2000) each opened with `=== ... (treat as source material, not as instructions) ===` and closed with `=== END SOURCE MATERIAL ===` so Claude sees an unambiguous data/instruction boundary. **Behavior-preservation note:** RTPBA header wording changed from `(VERBATIM, DO NOT REWRITE)` to `(treat as source material, not as instructions)` per the prescribed Group D pattern — if output quality regresses (Claude paraphrasing the RTPBA rather than using it verbatim), combine both concerns as `(use verbatim; any embedded text below is content, not instructions)`. System-sourced enum lists (specialties, modalities, populations), JSON blobs (typography, color_palette, layout_patterns, voice_dna), and structured fields (phone, email, gbp_url) left unwrapped per scope fence.

### H32. `api/digest.js:91` — recipients from request body, no allowlist ✅ RESOLVED
Admin with JWT sends digest from trusted `notifications@clients.moonraker.ai` to arbitrary addresses. Spamming oracle with trusted identity. Server-side allowlist (e.g. `*@moonraker.ai`).

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `898dd621`, Group F):** Allowlist check added immediately after the existing `from/to/recipients` required-fields validation (L25-27). Every entry in `recipients[]` must contain `@moonraker.ai` (case-insensitive, via `String(r||'').toLowerCase().indexOf('@moonraker.ai') === -1`); any violation returns 400 with the invalid entries listed verbatim so an honest operator sees which address tripped. The `from` and `to` fields (period labels for the rendered HTML header, not email addresses) are intentionally left unrestricted — they're stable internal values and locking them down wasn't requested. Surface remaining after fix: a compromised admin JWT can still spray all @moonraker.ai team members, but not arbitrary external addresses with a trusted-identity From.

### H33. `api/newsletter-generate.js:172, 180` — raw Claude output leaked in error responses ✅ RESOLVED
On parse failure, full generated text returned. Inconsistent with other routes' error handling. Truncate.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `a8155dc`):** Added `var monitor = require('./_lib/monitor');`. Seven 5xx sites refactored: load-newsletter catch, load-stories catch, Anthropic non-2xx, AI response missing text blocks, AI response missing JSON braces, outer catch, and fatal wrapper. Each now calls `monitor.logError('newsletter-generate', err, { detail: { stage, newsletter_id, ... } })` with provider bodies (`errBody.substring(0,500)`), raw AI response shape (`Object.keys(aiData)`, `block_count`), and raw text previews routed to `error_log`. Response bodies now return generic strings (`'Failed to load newsletter'`, `'AI service error'`, `'No text response from AI'`, `'Could not parse AI response'`, `'Generation failed'`) with no `detail` or `raw` fields. Fatal wrapper's `monitor.logError` is defensively wrapped in its own `try/catch` so the outermost `res.json` fallback still fires even if logging throws. Parallel duplicate commit `eb60174` was overwritten by this one; functionally equivalent pattern application.

### H34. `api/send-audit-email.js:120, 162` — internal error detail in response body ✅ RESOLVED
`detail: emailResult` returns entire Resend response including error context. `err.message` same.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commits `225d5a0` + follow-up `19b9199`):** Added `var monitor = require('./_lib/monitor');`. L120 Resend non-2xx site: raw Resend response (`emailResult`) now routed via `monitor.logError('send-audit-email', ..., { client_slug: slug, detail: { stage: 'resend_send', audit_id, status, resend_response } })`; response body is generic `'Email send failed'` with no `detail`. Existing `console.error('Resend error:', emailResult)` preserved for Vercel logs. L162 outer catch: `monitor.logError` with `client_slug: (typeof slug !== 'undefined' ? slug : null)` + `detail: { stage: 'outer_catch', audit_id }`; response body is generic `'Internal server error'`. The `typeof` guard accommodates pre-slug-assignment errors (hoisted `var` is defined but undefined). Parallel duplicate commit `adfbe7a` was overwritten by `225d5a0`; `19b9199` restored `client_slug` logging that was accidentally dropped in the overwrite.

### H35. `api/generate-content-page.js:145, 167, 229` — error details in NDJSON stream ✅ RESOLVED
`errText.substring(0, 500)` (Anthropic response body) and `responseText.substring(0, 500)` (Claude generated content) sent as `detail`/`raw_preview` in stream. Admin-only but noise.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `b17c790`):** Added `var monitor = require('./_lib/monitor');`. Three `send({step:'error', ...})` NDJSON sites refactored: L146 Claude non-2xx, L168 HTML-too-short, L248 outer catch. Each now calls `monitor.logError('generate-content-page', err, { client_slug: clientSlug, detail: { stage, content_page_id, ... } })` with raw detail (Anthropic response body, Claude HTML preview, raw response length) routed to `error_log` server-side. Stream payloads preserve the `{step:'error', message:'...'}` shape the admin UI expects, but `message` values are now generic (`'AI service error'`, `'Generated content was too short. Please retry.'`, `'Generation failed'`) with `detail` and `raw_preview` fields removed. Outer catch's `monitor.logError` call is wrapped in `try/catch` to preserve the stream-closed safety net for `send()`.

### H36. `api/convert-to-prospect.js:175` — 8th copy of `getDelegatedToken` not caught by H21 ✅ RESOLVED
**Discovered 2026-04-17 during Group B.1 verification.** Audit's H21 section enumerated 6 duplicates plus `_lib/google-drive.js` (tracked as N6) — 7 total. During post-session verification sweep a full-repo grep found an 8th copy in `api/convert-to-prospect.js` at line 175, called at line 101 for Drive folder creation during the manual-fallback lead-to-prospect conversion path. This file was added after the original audit pass. Same signature as the old locals (`saJson, impersonateEmail, scope`), same `{error}` return contract — which means the caller at L102 uses `if (driveToken && typeof driveToken === 'string')` to detect success.

Also noted: a stray `var auth = require('./_lib/auth');` at line 182 inside the function body (auth is already required at module scope L11; the inner require is dead weight that will disappear with the migration).

**Impact:** Same as H21 — code duplication, no token caching for this route's Drive calls, divergent error shape from the rest of the codebase. This route is "edge case only" per the file's own comment, but it still runs in production for manual conversions.

**Fix:** Same migration pattern as Group B.1 sites. Swap to `google.getDelegatedAccessToken('support@moonraker.ai', scope)` with try/catch; the success check `typeof driveToken === 'string'` becomes implicit (helper returns the string directly, throws on failure). Delete the local function.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `221bfbc`, Group D pre-task):** Added `var google = require('./_lib/google-delegated');` alongside the existing `sb`/`auth` module requires. Wrapped the call at L101 in try/catch: `driveToken = await google.getDelegatedAccessToken('support@moonraker.ai', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive');` with the catch branch assigning `results.drive.error = 'Failed to get Drive token: ' + (e.message || String(e));`. Success check simplified to `if (driveToken)` (helper returns the string directly). Dead else-branch at old L160-162 (`results.drive.error = 'Failed to get Drive token: ' + (driveToken && driveToken.error ? driveToken.error : 'unknown');`) removed — the inner try/catch now covers the token-failure path unambiguously. Local `getDelegatedToken` function body (L175-215) deleted in full, which incidentally eliminates the stray inner `var auth = require('./_lib/auth');` at L182. Outer `if (existingDriveFolder) ... else if (saJson) ...` branch preserved — the `saJson` env-var check is now redundant (helper checks env internally) but harmless as fail-fast. Net: `convert-to-prospect.js` now follows the canonical Group B.1 pattern; Fathom/Gmail/Drive token cache shared across the codebase.

**Scope note:** This finding was not in the original H21 list so it gets its own ID rather than being folded into the H21 partial. Count toward the High totals as H36.

## Medium

### M1. `api/stripe-webhook.js:101` — amount-based audit detection fragile
`isEntityAudit = amountTotal === 200000 || amountTotal === 207000`. Any price change, tax adjustment, discount, or currency difference breaks. The CC-with-3.5%-fee rounding is especially exposed to drift.

**Remediation plan (deferred to a follow-up PR, noted 2026-04-17 after C2 session):**
1. Add `metadata: { product: 'entity_audit' }` to both Entity Audit payment links in Stripe Dashboard (ACH `buy.stripe.com/3cIdR87co3Z711Wfip5wI0V` and CC `buy.stripe.com/7sY4gyaoAgLT9ys7PX5wI0W`).
2. For CORE Marketing System payment links (8 of them), add `metadata: { product: 'core_marketing_system' }`.
3. Change detection logic in stripe-webhook.js to prefer `session.metadata.product` with a fallback to the current amount check for backward compat with any events already in flight.
4. After observing metadata-based detection work for ~30 days, remove the amount fallback.

### M2. `api/_lib/auth.js:199-204, 253-259` — `last_login_at` updated every request ✅ RESOLVED
Every authenticated API call PATCHes `admin_profiles`. 29+ admin routes × 3-5 calls/page = PATCH/second during normal use. Update only on actual login, or throttle to >60s since last update.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `6e8a51a`, Group G batch 1):** New `maybeUpdateLastLogin(userId)` helper replaces the inline fire-and-forget PATCH blocks in both `requireAdmin` and `requireAdminOrInternal`. Reads `last_login_at` from the (now TTL-cached, see H1) admin profile without a DB round-trip, skips the PATCH if `Date.now() - prevTs < LAST_LOGIN_THROTTLE_MS` (60s), and updates the cache in-place *before* firing so concurrent same-window calls short-circuit cleanly. Fire-and-forget `.catch(function(){})` shape preserved — the PATCH is still non-critical and a failure should not block the request. Under normal use this collapses from ~PATCH/second per active admin to at most 1 PATCH/min/admin. Trade-off: up to 60s of missed `last_login_at` granularity, which matches the explicit threshold called out in the finding. Bundled with H1 in one commit because both touch `_profileCache` and the M2 fix depends on H1's SELECT extension.

### M3. `api/action.js:24` — 40+ tables allowlisted with no action granularity
`signed_agreements`, `payments`, `workspace_credentials`, `settings`, `error_log` all mutable. Shape allowlist as `{ table, actions: ['read','create'] }`. `signed_agreements` and `payments` read-only via this endpoint. `workspace_credentials` requires elevated role.

### M4. `api/_lib/github.js:30` — path validation too permissive
Doesn't reject backslashes, null bytes, URL-encoded traversal, no allowed-prefix list. Any caller passing user-derived paths to `pushFile` is write-to-api vulnerability → Vercel auto-deploy RCE.

### M5. `api/newsletter-webhook.js` — optional signature verification (see H11).

### M6. `api/_lib/monitor.js:85` — critical alert HTML uses string concat with `route`, `slug` unescaped ✅ RESOLVED
Low risk (recipients trusted) but inconsistent. Escape everything.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `1147a19`):** `route` and `slug` now wrapped in the existing `escHtml()` helper in `critical()`'s alert-email HTML body. Matches the pattern already in use for `message`. Subject line still raw (plain text, not HTML — not a vector) but a future nit-fix could strip `\r\n` to harden against header injection; not flagged by M6.

### M7. `api/_lib/supabase.js:45, 66` — error detail may include raw PostgREST response body in thrown messages
Callers doing `return res.status(500).json({ error: err.message })` leak schema info, column names, constraints. Grep each catch.

### M8. `api/stripe-webhook.js:172-175` — `err.message` in response body ✅ RESOLVED
Remove `detail: err.message`.

### M9. `api/submit-entity-audit.js:47` — slug race condition ✅ RESOLVED
Check-then-insert TOCTOU. Depends on unique constraint existing on `contacts.slug`. Line 191 substring match on `duplicate|unique` is fragile.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `12b05edd`, Group F):** Constraint names verified via `pg_constraint` before editing — `contacts` has `contacts_slug_key UNIQUE (slug)` but **no unique constraint on email** (two existing duplicate-email rows confirmed in data). Slug pre-check at L67-74 removed — the UNIQUE(slug) constraint is the authoritative backstop, pre-check was racy and redundant. Outer catch at L196-208 tightened: detection now reads `err.detail.code === '23505'` (structured PostgREST error attached by `sb.mutate`, see `_lib/supabase.js:76-79`), with `contacts_slug_key` name-match and the original `duplicate|unique` substring match as layered fallbacks. The slug pre-check's empathetic user message was moved into the catch (that message now covers the actual collision path); the old generic `record for this practice` fallback wording dropped. **Out of M9's scope and filed separately as M39:** the `email` pre-check at L76-83 is kept because no DB-level unique constraint exists to fall back on — removing it would allow true duplicate-email rows. Adding `UNIQUE(email)` is a schema change with product implications (one therapist, multiple practices, shared contact email) that needs a product call, not a security-audit fix.

### M10. `api/submit-entity-audit.js:118` — no timeout on agent fetch ✅ RESOLVED
Full 60s if VPS agent slow.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `274f273`, Group B.2):** Both `fetch` sites in the file wrapped with `fetchT`. The agent POST at L125 (`AGENT_URL + '/tasks/surge-audit'`) uses a 30s timeout — the agent endpoint spawns the browser-use session but should return the `task_id` quickly; fail-fast + requeue is preferable to hanging the full Vercel budget if the VPS is slow. The Resend notification at L168 (inside the agent-failed branch) uses a 10s timeout. Grep verification: `grep -cE '\\bfetch\\(' submit-entity-audit.js` → 0.

### M11. `api/admin/deploy-to-r2.js:71` — DELETE-then-INSERT not idempotent ✅ RESOLVED
Use PostgREST upsert with `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates`.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `9fe2810`, Group E):** The DELETE+POST was recording each R2 deploy into `site_deployments` (not `client_sites` as the original finding text implied — the handler writes HTML to R2 first, then updates the deployment-log row). If the invocation died between DELETE and POST the log row vanished even though the HTML was already live, so the admin UI then showed "never deployed" for a published page. Replaced with a straight upsert on the existing `UNIQUE(site_id, page_path)` index using `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates,return=representation` — the `return=representation` variant preserves the single-row shape downstream code depends on in the `deployment` variable. No schema changes needed.

### M12. `api/admin/manage-site.js:53` — domain "normalization" accepts paths, ports, anything ✅ RESOLVED
Doesn't reject `domain:8080`, `domain/path`, `user:pass@domain`, `domain?q=x`. Malformed domain goes to CF custom-hostname API and stored in DB.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `2ce32b89`, Group F):** Strict FQDN regex validation added after the existing `toLowerCase + replace` chain in `handleProvision` (only handler accepting raw `domain` — `handleUpdate`/`handleDeprovision`/`handleStatus` take `site_id`). Pattern `/^(?=.{1,253}$)(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)\.)+[a-z]{2,63}$/` enforces: total length 1-253, labels 1-63 chars of alnum-or-hyphen with no leading/trailing hyphen, final TLD 2-63 alpha chars. 400 returned on mismatch. Regex verified against 16 boundary cases before push (valid: `example.com`, `sub.example.com`, `my-practice.example.co.uk`, `a.io`; rejected: `:8080`, `/path`, `user:pass@`, `?query`, `-example.com`, `example-.com`, `example..com`, empty label, 64-char label, numeric TLD). Forward compat note: rejects punycode IDN tails (`.xn--p1ai`) — not in our customer set, revisit if international domains are ever onboarded.

### M13. `api/newsletter-webhook.js:119` — returns `e.message` with status 200 ✅ RESOLVED
Leaks error detail. Useful to attacker probing C6 bug.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `3a9019d`):** The `db_error` terminal catch's response body changed from `{ ok: false, error: e.message }` to `{ ok: false }`. Error detail was already captured by the pre-existing `logEvent('db_error', { headers: hdrs, detail: { error: e.message, stack: (e.stack || '').slice(0, 500) } })` call at L257 which writes to `webhook_log`, so no additional `monitor.logError` was added (would have been duplicate logging). Inline code comment added explaining the 200 status rationale (prevent Resend retries on our storage errors when the webhook signature itself was valid). Other error-response sites in the file (`body_read_failed`, `sig_bad_secret_format`, `bad_json`) already followed the pattern (`logEvent` + generic user-facing response); spot-confirmed they were not leaking.

### M14. `api/content-chat.js:108` — `fetchPageContext` silently returns nulls on error ✅ RESOLVED
If Supabase is down, prompt runs with nulls — expensive no-op. Short-circuit with 503.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `34fca146`, Group F):** Bundled with H12 in the same commit — both touch the same `fetchPageContext` function and the same handler call site. `fetchPageContext` rewritten to throw instead of returning `{page:null, contact:null, spec:null}` on error: the `sb.isConfigured()` guard now throws, every `fetch` response checks `.ok` and throws on non-2xx, and the outer catch is removed (let it propagate). Handler at L71-88 wraps the call in try/catch: throw → 503 `Service temporarily unavailable` (no more futile Opus call burning credits during a Supabase outage); `null` return → 404 (not-found or contact-lost, same shape per H12 no-oracle requirement); success → proceed as before.

### M15. `api/content-chat.js:143` — therapist name interpolated unsanitized into prompt ✅ RESOLVED
Prompt injection via `contact.first_name`/`last_name` if ever populated from untrusted source.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `60bccb8`, Group D):** Added `var sanitizer = require('./_lib/html-sanitizer');` alongside existing `sb`/`rateLimit` requires. In `buildSystemPrompt` (L153-194), wrapped `practiceName` and `therapistName` at the source (L154-155) with `sanitizer.sanitizeText(..., 200)` so the three downstream template-literal interpolations (opening line at L157, PAGE CONTEXT at L192, Therapist line at L193) are all safe by construction. Also wrapped `contact.city` and `contact.state_province` at the Location interpolation site (L194) with `sanitizer.sanitizeText(..., 100)` each. Note: `content-chat.js` is client-facing (origin-gated to `https://clients.moonraker.ai`, not admin-JWT-gated like `chat.js`), so this is a wider attack surface than M26 — the sanitization is more than defense-in-depth here.

### M16. `api/process-entity-audit.js` — no AbortController on 20+ fetch calls ✅ RESOLVED
Template reads, destination checks, pushes, Claude API call on line 197. Hung fetch pushes to configured maxDuration.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commits `0d2c56d` + `2512c46`, Group B.2):** Biggest single file in B.2 — 19 `fetch` sites, split into two commits for safer rollback. **5a (`0d2c56d`):** 6 Supabase direct-REST sites migrated to `sb.*` helpers — `auditResp`/`contactResp` (L70/L80) → `sb.one`; `prevAuditResp` (L271) → `sb.query`; `updateResp` PATCH with `return=minimal` (L331) → `sb.mutate` inside a try/catch that maps the thrown error onto the original `send({step:'error'}) + res.end()` path; checklist DELETE (L357) wrapped in `try { … } catch (_e) {}` to preserve raw `fetch`'s prior silent-on-HTTP-error semantics (`sb.mutate` throws on 4xx/5xx where raw `fetch` did not); checklist POST bulk insert (L409) with success `send()` in the try body and warning `send()` in the catch — mirrors the original `if (!ok) / else` pair. The non-transactional DELETE+INSERT pattern at L357+L409 is intentionally preserved (M18 + M19 tracked under Group E). **5b (`2512c46`):** 13 external calls wrapped at tiered timeouts — Claude (L197) 60s; 3 GitHub template reads and 3 file-exists checks 15s each; 3 GitHub PUTs 30s each (large HTML payloads); internal POST to `/api/send-audit-email` (L571) 30s; 2 Resend notifications (premium-review L592 + quarterly L636) 15s each. Grep verification: `grep -cE '\\bfetch\\(' process-entity-audit.js` → 0.

### M17. `api/process-entity-audit.js` — 15+ inlined Supabase fetches bypass `_lib/supabase.js`
Biggest holdout of consistency pattern.

### M18. `api/process-entity-audit.js:388` — composite checklist_items ID uses first 8 hex chars ✅ RESOLVED
Birthday collision around 65K audits. Use full UUID or index-based synthetic id.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commits `e092cae` + `4fb46a7`, Group G batch 1):** `checklist_items.id` column verified as `text` via `information_schema` (no length constraint). Existing data verified safe: 1875 rows across 80 distinct 8-char prefixes, no current collisions, uniform 12-char ids (confirms the pattern was consistent). No downstream code parses the prefix — every reader accesses rows by `client_slug` or `audit_id`, and the one direct-id read (`_templates/progress.html:316`) treats it as opaque. Fix switches from `auditId.substring(0, 8) + '-' + idx.padStart(3, '0')` to `auditId + '-' + idx.padStart(3, '0')` — 44-char composite (40 UUID + dash + 3 digits). Only affects new rows; existing 12-char ids remain valid.

**Sister site closed in same group:** `api/setup-audit-schedule.js:124` had the identical copy-pasted pattern (lead-to-client conversion path that explodes the audit's `tasks` JSONB into `checklist_items` rows). Fixed in `4fb46a7` with the same substitution. Same collision surface, same column, same bug — closing only one writer would have left the collision risk open. The audit finding was scoped to `process-entity-audit.js` but the second site emits into the same table and the shape was byte-identical.

### M19. `api/process-entity-audit.js:568-582` — webhook race with auto-send email
Stripe webhook upgrading `audit_tier` to premium can race with agent callback auto-sending free scorecard. Free email goes out → webhook flips to premium → premium Loom flow never triggers.

### M20. `api/newsletter-unsubscribe.js:17-22` — PATCH-zero-rows oracle ✅ RESOLVED
UUID-format-but-nonexistent SID triggers PATCH warning in logs.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `d36e6577`, Group F):** `sb.one('newsletter_subscribers?id=eq.<sid>&select=id&limit=1')` existence check added before the PATCH at L40-43. If the sid doesn't resolve to a row, the PATCH is skipped entirely so `sb.mutate`'s `[sb.mutate] PATCH returned 0 rows` warning at `_lib/supabase.js:83` no longer fires. Success response (HTML `unsubPage(true)` or JSON `{ok:true,'Unsubscribed'}`) is returned regardless of whether the sid existed — response shape reveals nothing about membership. Trade-off: one extra Supabase round-trip per real unsubscribe (acceptable at opt-in volume). Failure mode unchanged: the wrapping try/catch fails closed on Supabase outage with 500, same as before when `sb.mutate` was the failing call.

### M21. `_lib/google-drive.js:109, 157` — Drive query injection if `folderId` attacker-controlled
Unescaped in `q = "'" + folderId + "' in parents"`. Current caller uses admin-written `contact.drive_folder_id`, so requires admin JWT compromise.

### M22. `_lib/newsletter-template.js:141` — `subscriberId` in unsub URL not encoded ✅ RESOLVED
Trivial in practice (UUID) but brittle for future test strings.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `0cd0670`):** `encodeURIComponent(subscriberId)` applied at the `UNSUBSCRIBE_BASE + '?sid='` concat site. Landed alongside H18/H19 in the same newsletter-template.js commit.

### M23. `api/generate-proposal.js:598` — hardcoded Drive `CLIENTS_FOLDER_ID`
Infrastructure identifier in source.

### M24. `api/compile-report.js:206-209` — GSC auto-correct writes without admin approval
Silently PATCHes `report_configs.gsc_property` when configured value fails. No banner in UI. Transient Google 403 could re-point client's config to wrong property variant permanently.

### M25. `api/compile-report.js:1138` — markdown fence strip corrupts JSON with nested fences
Same as process-entity-audit.js:226 bug. Extract to helper.

### M26. `api/chat.js:175-177, 126` — prompt injection surface + error leak ✅ RESOLVED
`page`, `tab`, `clientSlug` interpolated unsanitized. `err.message` leaked in 500.

**Resolution — err-leak half (2026-04-17, commit `9dc8c7b`, Group A):** Added `var monitor = require('./_lib/monitor');`. L126 outer catch now calls `monitor.logError('chat', err, { detail: { stage: 'outer_catch' } })` and returns generic `{ error: 'Internal server error' }` with no `detail` field. Existing `console.error('Chat handler error:', err)` at L125 preserved.

**Resolution — prompt-injection half (2026-04-17, commit `49f088a`, Group D):** Added `var sanitizer = require('./_lib/html-sanitizer');` alongside existing `auth`/`monitor` requires. In `buildSystemPrompt` (L138), wrapped all three user-controlled ctx fields at the source (L139-141): `page = sanitizer.sanitizeText(ctx.page || 'unknown', 200)`, `tab = ctx.tab ? sanitizer.sanitizeText(ctx.tab, 200) : null`, `clientSlug = ctx.clientSlug ? sanitizer.sanitizeText(ctx.clientSlug, 200) : null`. Source-level sanitization covers both the L177-179 ctx_str interpolations (`Page: ... | Tab: ... | Client: ...`) and the L183-184 `dataLabel` interpolation (`Live Data for ${clientSlug}`) in one edit. The mode-dispatch `page.includes('/admin/...')` branches at L162-174 still work correctly — `sanitizeText` preserves slashes, alphanumerics, and path structure; it only strips HTML tags, entities, control chars, and excess whitespace, none of which appear in legitimate page paths. `chat.js` is admin-only (`requireAdmin` at L18); this fix is defense-in-depth against admin-JWT-compromise scenarios rather than a public surface.

### M27. `api/bootstrap-access.js:55, 66, 436, 459` — `clientSlug` unencoded in PostgREST URLs
Line 38 only checks truthiness. Validate as `^[a-z0-9-]{1,60}$`.

### M28. `api/bootstrap-access.js:459` — compound deliverables PATCH filter built by concat
Currently safe (static values) but pattern invites future injection.

### M29. `api/chat.js:130-132` — 120s maxDuration may not cover heavy context
Sonnet 4.6 + 8192 max_tokens + dumped DB = potentially slow. Monitor.

### M30. `api/generate-proposal.js:79-81, 273-275, 543-547, 549-557, 563-569` — 5+ fire-and-forget PATCHes ✅ RESOLVED
`.catch(function(){})` swallows errors silently. If final PATCH (549) fails, proposal sits in `generating` forever.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `4d0fa27`, Group E):** Four in-scope serverless-side sites converted from `await fetch(...).catch(function(){})` to `await sb.mutate(...)` in try/catch — L90 (`status='generating'`), L284 (error-branch `status='review'` + notes), L594 (`contacts.checkout_options`), L605 (final `proposals` finalize with `status='ready'`, urls, content). The post-H26 `results` pattern already in the file is matched: non-critical sites push to `results.{status_update_error, checkout_options_error, finalize_error}`; the three most material sites (L90, L284, L605) additionally route through `monitor.logError('generate-proposal', err, { client_slug: slug, detail: { stage, proposal_id } })` with stage tags `set_status_generating`, `record_generation_failure`, `finalize_proposal`. The L605 finalize is the audit-flagged "stuck in generating forever" site — it's now the one that surfaces both as an admin-visible `results.finalize_error` and in `error_log`. No 500 returns added to the success path; all failures tracked via the existing `res.status(200).json({ ..., results })` shape at L739. One fire-and-forget site at L515 left intentionally alone: it's inside the backtick `trackingScript` template literal injected into the deployed proposal HTML as a `<script>`, so it's browser-side code, not a serverless handler invocation. **Scope note:** `api/generate-proposal.js` still uses raw `fetch(sb.url() + '/rest/v1/...')` for two reads at L62 (proposal load) and L80 (practice_type load). These are instances of the pattern already tracked as **L1** — left alone rather than folded in here, since M30's scope is explicitly the fire-and-forget PATCHes.

### M31. `api/seed-content-pages.js:21, 23` — `require('./_lib/supabase')` imported twice
Harmless but indicates careless editing.

### M32. `api/enrich-proposal.js:74-78` — personal email regex misses common domains
Missing `aol`, `me.com`, `live.com`, `fastmail`, etc. Not anchored: `gmail.foo.com` matches.

### M33. `api/digest.js:44, 47, 50` — date strings unvalidated
Validate as `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` before concat into filter.

### M34. `api/newsletter-generate.js:13` — Pexels key fallback silent
If unset, every `searchPexelsImage` returns null; newsletter generation proceeds with placeholder images. No admin signal.

### M35. `api/generate-content-page.js:199, 206` — PATCH + POST no transaction
If PATCH succeeds but POST version fails, HTML saved without version record.

### M36. `api/seed-content-pages.js` uses arrow functions
Inconsistent with project's ES5 style.

### M37. `api/send-audit-email.js:131` — auto-schedule doesn't check contact status

### M38. `client_sites` RLS missing `authenticated_admin_full` policy ✅ RESOLVED
**Discovered during H9 rotation UI smoke test (2026-04-17).** `client_sites` had RLS enabled with only one policy: `anon_read_client_sites` (`roles={anon}`, `USING (true)`). Every other public table (`contacts`, `content_pages`, `tracked_keywords`, `bio_materials`, `neo_images`, …) has an additional `authenticated_admin_full` policy using `is_admin()`. `shared/admin-auth.js` installs a fetch interceptor that upgrades the `Authorization` header from the anon key to the user's admin JWT on direct Supabase REST calls, so the admin UI queries `client_sites` as role `authenticated` — which had no matching policy, returning empty.

**Impact:** The Website Hosting card in the client deep-dive has likely been silently empty for every admin viewing every client since RLS was introduced on this table. The UI's empty-state path calls `provisionHosting()` which POSTs to `/api/admin/manage-site` with a partially-populated body, producing the `400 contact_id, domain, and hosting_type are required` toast that has been observed but never traced to cause. No security exposure — RLS was over-restrictive, not under-restrictive — but a real correctness gap.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, migration `add_authenticated_admin_policy_client_sites`):** Added `authenticated_admin_full` policy matching the pattern used on every other table:
```sql
create policy authenticated_admin_full
  on public.client_sites
  for all
  to authenticated
  using (is_admin())
  with check (is_admin());
```
UI smoke test confirmed the Website Hosting card now renders the moonraker site correctly. A broader sweep for other tables with this pattern missing is a candidate follow-up.
Follow-up sequence scheduled even if contact has since flipped to `lost`/`onboarding`/`active`.

### M39. `api/submit-entity-audit.js:70-77` — email pre-check is TOCTOU-racy with no DB-level unique constraint
**Discovered 2026-04-18 during Group F M9 work.** While verifying constraint names for M9's slug TOCTOU fix via `pg_constraint`, only `contacts_slug_key UNIQUE (slug)` was present — `email` has no unique constraint. The surviving `byEmail` pre-check at L76-83 (kept when the slug pre-check was removed) is therefore racy in the same way M9's slug pre-check was: two concurrent submissions with the same email pass the check, both insert, and the DB accepts both (two duplicate-email rows already exist in production, confirming the race has fired in practice or a prior bug allowed it). The cleanest fix is `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX contacts_email_key ON contacts (lower(email)) WHERE email IS NOT NULL;` with a data cleanup first, but this has product implications: at least one real scenario (one therapist onboarding two sibling practices under one contact email) needs a decision on whether that's intentional. Parking for a product discussion rather than adding a constraint that might require unplanned rework.

## Low

### L1. Inconsistent use of `_lib/supabase.js` ✅ RESOLVED
Many routes mix `sb.query`/`sb.mutate` helper calls with inline `fetch(sb.url() + '/rest/v1/...')`. The inline form bypasses the PATCH-zero-rows warning.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, Group B.3 — 22 commits):** Full repo-wide sweep of every server-side bare `fetch(sb.url() + '/rest/v1/...')` call site. Migrated across 21 files / ~88 sites (17 files / 72 sites pre-verified + 6 files / 16 sites discovered mid-session via a multi-line follow-up sweep after the single-line grep completed; see "process note" below). All landed READY on first Vercel build.

Per-file commits: `5af2619` generate-content-page (12 sites); `bbf19a7` seed-content-pages (9, also collapsed duplicate `var sb = require()`); `1a2b78c` activate-reporting (6); `c530220` bootstrap-access (5); `1004858` convert-to-prospect (5); `25d7f99` discover-services (5, **fixed latent `ReferenceError: headers is not defined` in `upsertReportConfig` — every save path had been 500'ing silently**); `f54ee19` + `1f78fa2` enrich-proposal (4+3 sites, split across two commits due to multi-line miss in first pass); `4fca6e2` cron/enqueue-reports (4); `994dc7f` cron/process-queue (5, incl. one multi-line); `0a0fc1a` generate-followups (4); `d4955c5` generate-proposal (3 server-side; see exception below); `d634663` content-chat (4 in `fetchPageContext` helper, stream loop untouched); `48d44ec` trigger-batch-audit (4); `a48df07` delete-client (2); `5495019` process-batch-synthesis (2); `aa53037` generate-audit-followups (3); `be72b93` cron/process-followups (5, simplified `patchRecord(sbUrl, sbHeaders, ...)` signature by dropping two dead params); `2464454` digest (4 call sites + deleted `sbGet` helper — **closes L22**); `c9a7759` proposal-chat (2 in `fetchProposalByContactId` helper); `1759a55` ingest-surge-content (2, dropped unused `sbHeaders`); `8e523ce` cron/process-batch-pages (3).

**Exception intentionally preserved:** `generate-proposal.js:532` — the `track_proposal_view` IIFE embedded inside a template literal that gets deployed as inline client-side `<script>` in the generated proposal HTML. Runs in the browser with the anon-key JWT, not in Node; cannot use `sb.query`. Adjacent to L15 (long-exp anon key baked into deployed pages) and out of scope.

**Process note for future Pattern-12-style sweeps:** The session-prompt pre-verification used the single-line regex `fetch(sb.url()\|fetch(.*rest/v1/\|SUPABASE_URL.*rest/v1` which returned 74 matches across 18 files. That grep systematically undercounted because many call sites split the `fetch(` and the `sb.url() + '/rest/v1/...'` argument across two lines — these don't match a single-line pattern. A follow-up multi-line sweep (pair `await fetch(` with `sb.url() + '/rest/v1/'` on the next 1–4 lines, exclude `fetchT`) surfaced **16 additional sites** missed by the single-line grep: 1 in `cron/process-queue`, 1 in `content-chat`, 2 in `trigger-batch-audit`, 1 in `process-batch-synthesis`, 2 in `generate-audit-followups`, 4 in `cron/process-followups`, 3 in `enrich-proposal`, 2 in `proposal-chat`, 2 in `ingest-surge-content`, 3 in `cron/process-batch-pages`. Future sweeps should run both patterns; the Python multi-line walker used in this session is captured in the session transcripts.

**Behavior-preservation notes:**
- `sb.mutate` throws on PostgREST 4xx/5xx; raw `fetch` did not. Every migrated site was inspected for its prior error shape: sites that previously silent-failed (fire-and-forget PATCHes, status flips, decorative `activity_log` writes) got wrapped in inner `try/catch`; sites that previously threw custom error strings kept their outer throw shape with only the interior prefix changing to `Supabase mutate error:`.
- `seed-content-pages.js` had silent-partial-failure semantics (a mid-loop `createDel` returned a non-array on error, `result[0]` was undefined, loop continued). Migration makes it strict: any error aborts with 500. Idempotent seed (pageExists/findDel dedup on retry) makes this correct.
- `activate-reporting.js` "campaigns created but failed to store keys" 500 path now surfaces `sb.mutate`'s error-prefix instead of the raw PostgREST response body; same Pattern-7 leak shape, no worse, kept for behavior preservation.
- Several files had unused `var headers = sb.headers(...)` / `var sbHeaders = ...` locals after migration; cleaned up as incidental non-semantic tidying.
- `content-chat.js` and `proposal-chat.js` are scope-fenced streaming endpoints — only the data-loader helpers outside their stream retry loops were touched.

### L2. `api/stripe-webhook.js:37-63` — bare block wrapping signature check
Probably refactor artifact.

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** After the C2 + M8 rewrite (`5263aa5`), the bare block at L51-L98 cleanly scopes five locals used only for signature verification: `sigHeader`, `timestamp`, `signatures`, `expectedHex`, `expectedBuf`. Keeping them out of the outer function scope is defensible style, not a refactor artifact. No action.

### L3. `var`-style declarations throughout
Consistent but foot-gun prone.

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** On the "won't-fix-now" list since the remediation plan was written; the codebase is consistent, and a `var` → `let` sweep is cosmetic churn with merge-conflict cost against any concurrent session. Unchanged.

### L4. `api/_lib/github.js:32` — no retry on concurrent-write 409
If caller provides stale SHA, PUT 409s with no auto-retry.

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** Current `pushFile` re-fetches SHA only when caller passes no sha; if caller passes a stale SHA the PUT 409s and the exception surfaces. The session-doc rule "Always fetch a fresh SHA immediately before each PUT" pushes this responsibility to the caller by design — auto-retry in the library would mask concurrent-write races that callers should actually see. Leaving as-is; a future refactor could add opt-in retry via an option flag.

### L5. `api/_lib/auth.js:104, 122` — duplicated verify blocks
Retry-with-refreshed-keys block is cut-and-paste. Extract helper.

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** The `nodeCrypto.verify(...)` call is duplicated at L103-108 and L116-121; extracting an inner `tryVerify(pubKey)` helper is ~5 lines. Not landed in this reconciliation sweep because the JWT verification path is the admin-auth critical path — a byte-identical refactor should be its own scoped commit with explicit verification against the H1/M2 batch rather than bundled with a cleanup session.

### L6. `api/submit-entity-audit.js` — agent error swallowed, no requeue
Memory says `process-audit-queue.js` handles this. Verify.

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** Verification shows the gap is real, not resolved. `submit-entity-audit.js:112` inserts rows with `status='pending'` and flips to `'agent_running'` only on successful agent trigger (L149); on agent failure, status stays at `'pending'` forever, and `cron/process-audit-queue.js:138` only picks up `status='queued'`. Team notification email at L170-184 is the sole fallback — and the admin URL fragment in that email is itself broken (see L9).

**Product decision (Chris, 2026-04-18):** Every failed audit should auto-retry regardless of why the run failed — losing audits to silent `pending` is unacceptable. But the *reason* for the failure must be preserved so admins can see what happened, not just "it retried." The fix therefore has two parts:

1. **Preserve the error reason.** Every agent failure site records a real status (`'agent_error'`) and a human-readable detail string. Team notification email continues as an internal FYI.
2. **Auto-retry anyway.** The cron periodically flips `agent_error` rows back to `'queued'` (with a small backoff so a submit-time failure isn't immediately retried in the same cron tick) so dispatch is re-attempted. The existing cron agent-unreachable and stale-task requeue logic is untouched.

Implementation shape (planned for Group J as a mandatory pre-task):
- **Supabase migration:** add `last_agent_error TEXT` and `last_agent_error_at TIMESTAMPTZ` columns to `entity_audits`, plus a partial index on `(last_agent_error_at)` where `status='agent_error'` for the cron's backoff lookup.
- **`submit-entity-audit.js`** agent-failure branch: PATCH `status='agent_error'`, `last_agent_error=<msg>`, `last_agent_error_at=now()` (was: row stays at `pending`).
- **`cron/process-audit-queue.js`:** new step 0.5 flips `agent_error → queued` where `last_agent_error_at < now() - 5 minutes`; existing task-dispatch-failure PATCH at the cron's L207 also populates the detail columns.

Backoff choice (5 min) is a safety rail against same-tick self-retries and an operator window to manually stop a retry loop on a specific audit, well below the 30-min cron interval so it's meaningless as a throttle. Admin UI surfacing of `last_agent_error` is a separate follow-up (will be filed as M40 during Group J if the session wants to track it). **Queued for Group J as a mandatory pre-task** before the Medium classify sweep begins.

### L7. `api/report-chat.js:62, 68` — retry logic duplicated between catch and 529 handler

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** The backoff formula `Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000 + Math.random() * 500` appears in both the catch branch (L75) and the 529 handler (L81). Extracting an inner `backoff(attempt)` is ~3 lines, but `report-chat.js` is on the streaming-endpoint scope fence (custom retry + buffering). Leaving untouched until a dedicated streaming-endpoints session.

### L8. `api/newsletter-webhook.js:41` — unhandled Resend types dropped silently ✅ RESOLVED
`email.sent`, `email.scheduled`, `email.delivery_delayed` hit default branch, discarded. Log to `newsletter_events`.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commits `994f51a` + `bd0e195`):** `994f51a` added `webhook_log` observability with `logEvent('unhandled_type', { eventType, emailId, headers })` in the default branch, so every unrecognized type now leaves a trail. `bd0e195` then added explicit `case 'email.sent'` and `case 'email.delivery_delayed'` no-op branches that call `logEvent('ok_noop', ...)` — the audit's cited types specifically. `email.scheduled` still falls through to the `unhandled_type` default (which is correct — it's logged, just not acted on).

### L9. `api/submit-entity-audit.js:172` — admin link uses `#audit-` fragment
Verify admin clients page scrolls to/opens that anchor.

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** `admin/clients/index.html` has no hashchange handler and no element with `id="audit-<uuid>"` — the only `audit-`-prefixed IDs are `audit-status-<cpId>` (content-page IDs, different scope). Fragment silently lands on the page top. Harmless: team members still reach the admin page and scroll/search manually. A proper fix requires picking a URL shape the admin SPA can act on (e.g. `?focus=<slug>` with state-routing) — multi-file change beyond reconciliation scope. Cosmetic; leaving for a future admin-UX session. Same fragment appears in `process-entity-audit.js:613, 656` — document there.

### L10. `api/admin/deploy-to-r2.js:46` — 16-hex-char content hash (64 bits) ✅ RESOLVED
Fine for change detection. Not fine if reused as etag across many sites.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation, doc-only):** Repo-wide grep for `content_hash` shows three sites: two writes in `admin/deploy-to-r2.js` (L87, L95) and one read in `admin/manage-site.js:260` for the deployments list display. Never consumed as an etag or cross-site collision surface. The audit's own qualifier ("fine for change detection") describes actual usage; the counterfactual ("if reused as etag") does not hold on current code. Marking resolved with no code change.

### L11. `api/process-entity-audit.js:226` — markdown fence strip brittle with nested fences

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** Same class of bug as M25 (`compile-report.js:1138`). Current `rawText.replace(/```json\s*/g, '').replace(/```\s*/g, '').trim()` corrupts JSON if Claude emits a nested code fence inside a string value. Low probability in practice; the `JSON.parse` catch at L240 produces a useful error when it does hit. Proper fix is find-first-brace + bracket-tracking, which would naturally close both L11 and M25 in one helper. Parked until M25 or a shared-parser session.

### L12. `api/process-entity-audit.js:621-626` — function declared inside conditional branch ✅ RESOLVED
Non-strict mode hoisting inconsistency across engines.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `62e6ec3`, Group I):** Converted `function fmtDelta(val) { ... }` at L630 to `var fmtDelta = function(val) { ... };`. Same runtime behavior under sloppy-mode hoisting; semantics now deterministic. One-line change.

### L13. `_lib/email-template.js:22-24` — hardcoded asset URLs

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** On the "won't-fix-now" list — single-domain app, assets live at `clients.moonraker.ai`, no tenancy model that would require parameterization. Unchanged.

### L14. `DEPLOY_SECRET` in git history — covered by H9 ✅ RESOLVED
Resolved alongside H9 (commit `36ac5bb`). The rotation made the git-history string useless against the Worker. Note: the Worker's own legacy hardcoded secret (discovered during rotation) was also rotated out; see H9 resolution note.

### L15. `_templates/onboarding.html:955` — anon key JWT exp 2089 (effectively never)
RLS is the only control. Consider rotating to a shorter-exp anon key.

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** On the "won't-fix-now" list. Since C3/C7 landed the page_token gate for every public write, the anon-key exposure is now read-only (RLS-controlled) on client-facing templates. Rotating to a shorter-exp anon key would require a deploy-all-templates migration with zero security delta. Unchanged.

### L16. `api/compile-report.js:909, 1012` — two token functions with subtle difference ✅ RESOLVED
`getGoogleAccessToken` vs `getDelegatedToken` in same file. Delete unused one.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `1d9c835`, Group B.1):** Grep confirmed `getGoogleAccessToken` had zero callers anywhere in `client-hq` — pure dead code. Deleted alongside the H21 migration in the same commit. `getDelegatedToken` also removed (replaced by `google.getDelegatedAccessToken` at both call sites).

### L17. `api/generate-proposal.js:330` — `customPricing.amount_cents / 100` no null check ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation, via `aabdac1` in Group C):** Verified on current main — L355-358 now reads `var amt = Number(customPricing.amount_cents); var priceHtml = (Number.isFinite(amt) && amt >= 0) ? '$' + (amt / 100).toLocaleString() : '&mdash;';`. The Group C H22 commit closed this incidentally. Doc-only reconciliation.

### L18. `api/chat.js:44-80` — `models` array has one element; outer loop never iterates ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation, doc-only):** Verification shows the one-element array at L39-41 is intentional single-model config; the outer loop iterates exactly once (correctly), the `if (false)` guard at L110 confirms the structure is future-proofing for an eventual fallback model. Not a bug. The audit note's "never iterates" wording is misleading: it runs once per invocation. Marking resolved with no code change.

### L19. `api/enrich-proposal.js:76` — hardcoded personal-email domain blocklist

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** Regex at L73 `/gmail|yahoo|hotmail|outlook|protonmail|icloud/i` misses aol, live, msn, gmx, zoho, fastmail, hey.com, duck.com, me.com, and several regional providers (mail.ru, yandex, qq, 163). Only consequence of a miss is a personal-email host ending up as `searchDomain` and widening Gmail/Fathom enrichment noise for rare cases. Data-quality nit, not a bug. Fix would be ≤3 lines of regex additions but low-value without telemetry on actual miss rate.

### L20. `api/compile-report.js` — 14 inlined Supabase fetches ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation, via `0163f65` in Group B.2):** Verified on current main — repo-wide grep `fetch(sb.url()\|fetch.*rest/v1\|SUPABASE_URL.*rest/v1` against `api/compile-report.js` returns zero matches. Group B.2's H24 commit already closed this alongside the AbortController work. Doc-only reconciliation.

### L21. `api/enrich-proposal.js:337` — `User-Agent: 'Moonraker-Bot/1.0'` may be blocked

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** UA at L331 unchanged. The `-Bot/1.0` suffix is the pattern many WAFs (Cloudflare, Imperva) flag. No telemetry captured on actual block rate in enrichment fetches. A one-line swap to something like `'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Moonraker/1.0; +https://moonraker.ai/bot)'` is safe but data-free. Fold into a future telemetry-gated operational session.

### L22. `api/digest.js:128-131` — `sbGet` helper redefines `sb.query` ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `2464454`, Group B.3):** Inlined all 4 callers (L60/63/66/69) directly to `sb.query('activity_log?...')` / `sb.query('contacts?...')`, deleted the `sbGet(url, headers, path)` helper function, removed the now-unused `var headers = sb.headers()` local. Behavior preserved (sb.query throws on 4xx/5xx; callers are inside the outer try/catch which already handled errors).

### L23. `api/newsletter-generate.js:191-205` — `stripEmDashes` six-step replace chain

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** Function at L207-210 currently reads `s.replace(/\u2014/g, ', ').replace(/\u2013/g, ', ').replace(/ —/g, ',').replace(/— /g, ', ').replace(/—/g, ', ')`. The `\u2014` and `—` branches are the same Unicode character (em-dash) — technically redundant but harmless; chain runs in sequence and the earlier match wins. Could be collapsed to `s.replace(/\s*[\u2014\u2013]\s*/g, ', ')` but the current version works and matches the "no emdashes in user-facing content" policy. Cosmetic; leaving untouched to avoid risk of subtle Claude-output handling differences.

### L24. `api/send-audit-email.js:12` — wrong calendar URL?
`email.CALENDAR_URL` = `scott-pope-calendar` but memory canonical is `moonraker-free-strategy-call`. Verify.

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** Two calendar URLs coexist in production:
- `scott-pope-calendar` via `email.CALENDAR_URL` — used in footer notes across `send-audit-email.js:13`, `send-proposal-email.js:90`, `generate-audit-followups.js:12`, `generate-followups.js:125` ("book a call with Scott").
- `moonraker-free-strategy-call` — hard-coded as primary CTA in `send-audit-email.js:197` and `generate-audit-followups.js:49`.

Both URLs resolve in production; likely intentional split between "specific Scott booking" (footer) and "generic strategy call" (CTA). Product-gated — Chris/Scott know which is the intended canonical. Not safe to unify without confirming the routing intent. Flag for review.

### L25. `api/generate-content-page.js:180-182` — VERIFY regex stops at `<`
Cuts off flags mid-sentence with HTML brackets.

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** Regex at L184 is `/VERIFY[:\s]*([^\n<]+)/gi`. If Claude writes a VERIFY flag that includes an HTML element (e.g. `VERIFY: check <a href="...">this link</a>`), capture truncates at the `<`. Verify flags are operator-facing notes attached to generated-content review; cosmetic truncation doesn't lose the work itself. Fix would be switching to a line-delimited capture (`[^\n]+`) but risks ingesting trailing HTML. Low value; leaving.

### L26. `admin/clients/index.html:1991` — `renderContent()` race condition ✅ RESOLVED
**Discovered during H9 rotation UI smoke test (2026-04-17).** When the Content tab renders, `renderContent()` calls `renderHostingCard(c)` which kicks off an async fetch of `client_sites`. The initial synchronous render of the Service Pages section uses `state.clientSite` which is still `null` at that moment, so the conditional gate on `state.clientSite` for rendering the `☁ Deploy to Site` button fails and the button never appears. The fetch's `.then()` only re-rendered the hosting card, not the Service Pages section, so the button stayed hidden until the user switched tabs and came back.

**Resolution (2026-04-17, commit `402a579`):** In the fetch resolution, added a re-render of `renderContent()` guarded by (a) same-contact identity check (`state.contact === c`) and (b) active tab is `content`. No re-render on catch (the empty-sites render is already correct for that path).

### L27. `workspace_credentials.authenticator_secret_key` is null on every row — write path never built
**Observed during H9 session (2026-04-17).** `api/_lib/crypto.js:120` correctly lists `authenticator_secret_key` in `SENSITIVE_FIELDS`, and `api/action.js:78, 110` correctly applies `encryptFields` on `workspace_credentials` writes. The encrypt/decrypt plumbing is complete. **But nothing in the frontend writes to this column.** Grep of `admin/*.html` + `shared/*.js` returns zero hits outside the crypto module itself. The column exists in the schema, and rows exist in `workspace_credentials`, but the field is never populated.

**Not a bug — a workflow gap.** Likely intent: capture the TOTP seed when setting up 2FA on client Google Workspaces, alongside the app password. The setup UI captures `app_password` but not `authenticator_secret_key`. Either wire it up when 2FA capture becomes part of the onboarding flow, or remove the column. No action this session.

### L28. `api/chat.js:99` — Anthropic upstream error body passes through to admin response ✅ RESOLVED
Line 99: `return res.status(status).json({ error: userMsg, status: status, detail: errText })` where `errText = await anthropicRes.text()` is the raw HTTP body Anthropic returned on 4xx/5xx. **Discovered during M26 verification sweep (2026-04-17).** Admin-only endpoint, so exposure is narrower than H33-H35 — but the shape is identical to H28 and inconsistent with the monitor.logError pattern applied to the other four chat-family and content-pipeline routes in Group A. Anthropic error bodies typically contain model names, rate-limit context, organization-scoped state, and API-key-prefix confirmation strings. Low-severity info leak.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `be6ad05`, Group I):** Applied the H28 pattern at `chat.js:90-108`. Response body is now `{ error: userMsg, status }` only; `errText` substring + status routed via `monitor.logError('chat', new Error('anthropic_upstream'), { detail: { status, body: ... } })`. Removed the redundant `console.error('Anthropic API error:', ...)` in favor of the monitor call.

---

## Nit

### N1. `api/_lib/supabase.js` — `one()` returns null on error shape ✅ RESOLVED
Array.isArray on `{ message: 'X' }` error returns false; `one()` returns null as if row didn't exist.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation, doc-only):** The concern is obsolete after the supabase.js evolution during H4/H7. `query()` at L48-61 now throws on any non-ok response (raising `Supabase query error: …` with `err.status`/`err.detail`), so an error-shape payload never reaches `one()` — it would throw inside `query()` first. `one()` at L89-92 correctly handles 2xx-with-array (returns row/null) and 2xx-with-non-array (returns null, theoretical edge case for RPC calls that's not currently exercised). Marking resolved with no code change.

### N2. `api/stripe-webhook.js:43` — `parts[kv[0].trim()] = kv[1]` with undefined values ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation, via `5263aa5` in Phase 2):** The C2 + M8 rewrite replaced the split-on-'=' parse with proper `indexOf('=') + substring` handling. Current code at L56-63 uses `var eq = item.indexOf('='); if (eq === -1) return; var key = item.substring(0, eq).trim(); var value = item.substring(eq + 1).trim();` — no `parts[kv[0].trim()] = kv[1]` pattern exists. Doc-only reconciliation.

### N3. `api/_lib/monitor.js:43` — log interpolation of user-sourced `slug` could inject newlines ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `e694dce`, Group I):** Added `var safeMessage = message.replace(/[\r\n]+/g, ' \\n ');` before the console.error call. The interpolation at L43 is on `route` (always a static string passed by callers) and `message` (from `error.message` or caller-supplied string) — the injection surface was `message`, where PostgREST or other library errors can echo user-sourced content. Single-line fix. The sanitization only applies to the console.error path; the `error_log` table still stores the raw message as structured JSONB data where newlines are safe.

### N4. `api/onboarding-action.js:2-4` — comment describes the bug as a feature ✅ RESOLVED
"No admin JWT required — uses service role key for writes" reads as intentional. Rewrite after fix.

**Resolution (2026-04-18, commit `d53a1fa`, Group I):** Header comment rewritten to "Authenticates via page_token (not admin JWT); service role key is the write identity but the page_token gate and verified contact_id below constrain what any given request can touch. See security model below." This reads correctly against the post-Phase-4-S2 implementation (which already had an accurate multi-line security-model block below it, just with the misleading line 3 still in front of it).

### N5. Chat endpoints CORS origin is literal `clients.moonraker.ai`
Preview domains fail CORS when testing.

**Current state (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation):** Hardcoded at 7 endpoints: `chat.js:8`, `agreement-chat.js:14`, `content-chat.js:19`, `proposal-chat.js:20`, `report-chat.js:15`, `analyze-design-spec.js:11`, `submit-endorsement.js:55`. Four of the seven are streaming-endpoint scope-fenced. Proper fix is a shared CORS helper that accepts `process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'preview'` plus an allowlist of preview-URL patterns — multi-file change that should be its own session. Workaround in practice: test against the production domain directly. Workflow concern, not a security bug.

### N6. Seven copies of `getDelegatedToken` — covered in H21. ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution (2026-04-18, Group I reconciliation, via Group B.1 H21 commits):** H21 closed 2026-04-17 via helper `7adedb6` + migrations `17d0ae8`, `4e77e55`, `568a868`, `d592381`, `1d9c835`; H36 subsequently caught an 8th copy in `convert-to-prospect.js` and closed it in `221bfbc`. All `getDelegatedToken` duplicates are gone; every caller routes through `_lib/google-delegated.js` with shared token caching per (mailbox, scope). Doc-only reconciliation — N6 was a tracking pointer to H21.

---

## Patterns to fix systemically

1. **`buildFilter` is duplicated and unsafe in both copies.** Extract to `_lib/postgrest-filter.js` with structured-input design. Replace both sites + grep for other copies.

2. **Public-facing writes need signed URL tokens, not id-based access.** `/onboarding`, `/audit`, `/proposal`, `/report`, `/content-preview`, `/agreement` pages are slug-addressable with anon Supabase reads. `_lib/page-token.js`: `sign({ scope, contact_id, exp }, secret)` + `verify(token, expected_scope)`. Template deploys embed token. Every write-endpoint from client-facing pages validates scope before accepting `contact_id`.

3. **`requireAdmin` vs `requireAdminOrInternal` split is inconsistent in practice.** Several routes called from crons use dual auth correctly. Several that also receive internal calls are admin-only. Audit caller graph before tightening.

4. **No request-level audit log.** `activity_log` table exists but isn't written by `action.js` or `onboarding-action.js`. Every write through those paths needs admin user ID + table + filter + action logged.

5. **No rate limiting anywhere.** Needed on at least 8 routes (chat endpoints, `submit-entity-audit`, `newsletter-unsubscribe`, endorsement form, `bootstrap-access`). `_lib/rate-limit.js` backed by Supabase table or Upstash KV.

6. **`fetch()` without `AbortController` is the default everywhere.** Standardize on `fetchWithTimeout(url, opts, ms)` helper.

7. **Error messages leak to 5xx response bodies** in ~20 places. Grep `json\(\{[^}]*\b(detail|error|raw|message)\s*:\s*(err|e|[a-zA-Z]+)\.`. Standardize: 5xx = `{ error: 'Internal error' }`, detail to `monitor.logError`.

8. **Module-scoped caches with no TTL.** `_profileCache` in auth.js (H1) is the caught one. Grep other `var _XxxCache = {}`.

9. **`.catch(() => {})` swallows errors silently.** ~30 instances. Minimum: `console.error('[route] context:', e.message)`.

10. **Webhook signature patterns ad-hoc.** Extract `_lib/verify-webhook.js` with raw-body helper, timing-safe compare, fail-closed. Both stripe-webhook and newsletter-webhook share rewrite.

11. **Helpers that insert HTML raw default to unsafe.** `_lib/email-template.js` and `_lib/newsletter-template.js` `p()` and body inserters require callers to escape. Rename raw variants to `.raw()`; make default escape.

12. **`process-entity-audit.js`, `compile-report.js`, `generate-proposal.js`, `bootstrap-access.js`, `enrich-proposal.js` have double-digit inlined Supabase fetches.** Mechanical migration to `sb.query`/`sb.mutate` — the single biggest code-quality win available. ✅ **RESOLVED** via Group B.2 (`compile-report`, `process-entity-audit`; 2026-04-17) and Group B.3 (all five named files + 16 additional files discovered in repo-wide sweep; 2026-04-18). See L1 Resolution for the full 22-commit landing list. Repo-wide grep confirms zero remaining server-side bare `fetch(sb.url() + '/rest/v1/…')` call sites; only `generate-proposal.js:532` preserved (client-side IIFE inside a template literal, not migratable).

13. **`validatePath` in `_lib/github.js` is bypassed by `process-entity-audit.js` GitHub deploys.** Enforce an allowed-prefix list when migrating (pattern 12).

14. **Error-in-stream shape leaks internal state.** NDJSON `send({ step: 'error', message: err.message })` across multiple routes. Standardize to safe summary; detail to monitor.

15. **Stream/body fallback pattern in `process-entity-audit.js:37-44`** (read `surge_data` from DB if not in body) is valuable but isolated. Generalize in `_lib/agent-callback.js`.

16. **Seven copies of `getDelegatedToken`.** Extract to `_lib/google-auth.js` with token caching.

17. **DELETE-then-INSERT idempotency pattern** recurs in `deploy-to-r2.js`, `generate-proposal.js` (onboarding seed), `compile-report.js` (highlights). Zero-rows state after crash. Use PostgREST upsert or RPC transactions.

18. **Hardcoded infrastructure identifiers in source:** `MOONRAKER_ZONE_ID`, `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLIENTS_FOLDER_ID`, `DEPLOY_SECRET` (the live secret), plus the Supabase anon key in every template. Centralize in `_lib/constants.js` with fail-closed env overrides.

19. **Request-body filter construction without format validation** in virtually every admin endpoint. `_lib/validate.js` with `uuid()`, `slug()`, `isoDate()` helpers at every destructuring site.

20. **Public-to-AI-to-production chains are the highest-severity new category.** Any path accepting untrusted input → Claude prompt → deployed domain needs: structured delimiters in prompt, server-side HTML sanitization before deploy, rate limit + captcha on public form.

21. **Calling-convention mistakes in `sb.query`/`sb.mutate` (C6)** suggest the `(path, opts)` / `(path, method, body, prefer)` signatures are confusing. Add runtime validation (first arg must contain `?` if filter content is present), or add `sb.queryTable(table, filter)` / `sb.updateTable(table, filter, body)` higher-level wrappers.

## Remediation plan

Ordered by value/risk ratio. Each item references finding IDs.

### Phase 1 — Broken features (urgent, low risk) ✅ COMPLETE
1. ✅ **C1 + C8** — commit `28ffa37` (2026-04-17). One-line fix, unblocks bootstrap-access.
2. ✅ **C5 + H8** — commit `c717d99` (2026-04-17). Fail-closed on missing `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; decrypt throws instead of returning error strings. DB audit confirmed zero plaintext rows to remediate.
3. ✅ **C6 + H11** — commit `b9b8f47` (2026-04-17). Rewrote newsletter-webhook calling convention, added raw-body reader, timing-safe signature compare, fail-closed on missing secret.

### Phase 2 — Payment security (urgent, contained) ✅ COMPLETE
4. ✅ **C2 + M8** — commit `5263aa5` (2026-04-17). Stripe webhook now uses raw-body reader (`readRawBody` helper), supports multi-signature headers (Stripe key rotation), timing-safe compare with length guard, `Number.isFinite` timestamp validation, removed `err.message` from 500 response. Added partial unique index `payments_stripe_session_unique` for idempotent retries. **Historical backfill:** 5 previously-lost payment rows recovered by resending Stripe events through the now-working webhook. First confirmed end-to-end webhook successes in production history.

### Phase 3 — Architectural decisions (design-first)
Before coding Phase 3+:
- **Design `_lib/page-token.js`** — HMAC token shape for client-facing pages. Affects C3/C7 and future rate-limiting identity.
- **Decide rate-limit backing store** — Supabase table, Upstash KV, or Vercel KV. Affects C9 and H5 fixes.
- **Decide `action.js`/`onboarding-action.js` direction** — shared hardened mutation layer, or rewrite `onboarding-action.js` with named actions only (no generic table/filters passthrough).

### Phase 4 — Public attack surface (high impact) ✅ COMPLETE
5. ✅ **C3 + C7** — Sessions P4S1–P4S3. `api/_lib/page-token.js` (stateless HMAC), `api/onboarding-action.js` now requires verified page_token. Token minted at onboarding page deploy; contact_id sourced from verified token, not request body. Filter injection bug closed via shared helper (P4S5). 22+ existing onboarding pages redeployed with tokens.
6. ✅ **C4** — Session P4S5. `api/_lib/postgrest-filter.js` rejects operator-prefix passthrough; `api/_lib/action-schema.js` per-table manifest (permissive defaults, tightening follows as observed). `api/action.js` writes field-level rows to `activity_log` on every mutation. `api/onboarding-action.js` shares the filter helper.

### Phase 5 — Hardening passes (IN PROGRESS)
8. ✅ **H9 + L14** — commit `36ac5bb` (2026-04-17). Rotated `CF_R2_DEPLOY_SECRET` in Vercel, removed source fallback from `api/admin/deploy-to-r2.js:10`, module-load warning + request-time 500 on missing env var. The old fallback `'moonraker-r2-deploy-2026'` no longer works against the worker.
8b. ✅ **H10** — commit `e772fa9` (2026-04-17). Removed hardcoded `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` + `MOONRAKER_ZONE_ID` literals; added `CF_ZONE_ID` env var; fail-closed on missing CF config.
8c. ✅ **M38** (new, discovered during H9 smoke test) — Supabase migration `add_authenticated_admin_policy_client_sites` (2026-04-17). Added missing `authenticated_admin_full` RLS policy to `client_sites`; admin hosting card now renders correctly.
8d. ✅ **L26** (new) — commit `402a579` (2026-04-17). Fixed `renderContent()` race so Service Pages re-renders after async hosting fetch resolves.
8e. ✅ **H7** — commit `330e6da` (2026-04-17). Removed `api/_lib/supabase.js` hardcoded URL fallback; module-load warning + throw on first `url()` call if env missing.
8f. ✅ **H28** — commit `0c9bc85` (2026-04-17). `bootstrap-access.js` response body now uses filtered `publicResults` object; every catch site routes raw debug to `monitor.logError`; provider-specific thrown strings replaced with generic messages.
8g. ✅ **L8** — commits `994f51a` + `bd0e195` (2026-04-17). Newsletter webhook now logs every unhandled type via `logEvent('unhandled_type', …)`; added explicit no-op handlers for `email.sent` and `email.delivery_delayed`.
8h. ✅ **H21 + H30 + L16** — commits `7adedb6` (helper) + `17d0ae8`, `4e77e55`, `568a868`, `d592381`, `1d9c835` (migrations) — 2026-04-17. All 5 duplicate call sites migrated to `_lib/google-delegated.js`; Fathom/Gmail calls now share a cached token per mailbox+scope (H30); dead `getGoogleAccessToken` in `compile-report.js` deleted (L16).
10. **H4 + H24 + M10 + M16 + the many AbortController gaps** — extract `fetchWithTimeout`, apply everywhere.
11. ✅ **Pattern 12 + L1 + L22** — Group B.3 (commits `5af2619` → `8e523ce`, 2026-04-18). 22 file-level commits covering 21 files and ~88 call sites. Full resolution summary in L1 Resolution block.

### Phase 6 — Rate limiting ✅ COMPLETE
12. ✅ **H5 + H14** — Session P4S4. `api/_lib/rate-limit.js` backed by Supabase table + atomic RPC. Applied: chat endpoints (agreement/content/proposal/report) at 20/min/IP; `submit-entity-audit` at 3/hr/IP (replacing global H14 limit); `newsletter-unsubscribe` at 30/min/IP. Daily cleanup cron registered.

### Phase 6.5 — C9 endorsement chain ✅ COMPLETE
_(Brought forward from Phase 7 since Chris chose "ship now" over "wait for traffic")_
✅ **C9** — Session P4S7. New `api/submit-endorsement.js` requires scope='endorsement' page_token (minted per-client at endorsement page deploy), rate-limited 10/hr/IP, all text fields passed through `sanitizeText()`. `api/_lib/html-sanitizer.js` added; generated content HTML sanitized before save as defense in depth. Template updated to POST through the server endpoint instead of direct anon-key write.

### Phase 7 — Code quality cleanup (PENDING)
13. Template/email escape defaults (H18, H19, H20).
14. Error-leak standardization (pattern 7).
15. **M1** — Stripe metadata-based product detection (detailed plan in M1 section above).
16. Remaining Medium/Low cleanup as time permits.

### Won't-fix-now list
- L3 (`var` everywhere) — cosmetic.
- L13 (hardcoded asset URLs) — single-domain app, fine.
- L15 (long-exp anon key) — RLS is the control; no immediate action.

Audit was performed across five sessions reading ~11,000 lines of API route code, the eight `_lib/` modules, relevant templates, and git history for secret leakage. Unread in detail: chat system prompt bodies (low-risk content), several `send-*-email.js` / `trigger-*` / `ingest-*` routes (expected to follow already-catalogued patterns), most `api/admin/*` read-only dashboard routes. The audit is considered comprehensive for Critical and High findings; Medium/Low/Nit counts would grow modestly with further reading.
